Let me address a couple of those possibilities: (1) You are a Software Engineer with some years of experience In this case, I would recommend you take the following steps: Learn some basics of ML (see My answer to Machine Learning: How do I learn machine learning? ) Find a job or position in a team that does ML, but where your role is mostly to support software engineering (This should be relatively easy to do if you are a great software engineer and you show your interest in ML by having done (1)). Continue learning “on the job” and don't miss any opportunity to get more and more involved in the details of the ML algorithms you/your team is working on Progressively move into doing more ML until it becomes your “full-time” job (2) You are an CS undergrad about to graduate You could start a career as a software engineer and then go into (1) or... You could decide to do some graduate work (Master or PhD) in ML to get you jump started (3) You are a “science” PhD or researcher I am assuming you have used ML and become somewhat proficient at applying it for studying data and phenomena. Otherwise, you should learn the basics of ML (see My answer to Machine Learning: How do I learn machine learning? ) Improve your coding. You might have used some R (or worse, Matlab). I would recommend you do yourself a favor and learn Python. There are many places now that specialize on training people with this kind of background through Data Science boot camps and the like (see Zipfianacademy for example). I don't know enough about these to recommend them, but it might be a good way to improve 1 and 2. There are even universities that have courses in teaching coding/software engineering to Data Scientists (see this course at UW, for example). Get a job as a Data Scientist and progressively move into doing more and more ML Of course, there are infinite variations of the three situations above, and I don't claim these simple pieces of advice are enough.

I like to think of a data science problem like a Nintendo game: Some parts can be very frustrating and make you want to quit, but if you power through it, you get to enjoy the fun of beating the game. Interesting - Following how a problem is solved from start to finish is very appealing to those interested in STEM fields. The feeling is comparable to eating your favorite chips, once you get one piece of information, you have to have more until you have to tell yourself to stop. And then have another anyway. Exciting - In data science and machine learning in particular, new approaches are being introduced almost every day. This makes you realize how incredible it is to be a part of an era where technology is making advances we couldn’t have fathomed even 10 years ago. This thrill can make you feel as if you are a part of an elite group that has been appointed to change the world. You might not contribute a whole lot, but you know you’re included. Confusing - When researching a topic, it’s more often than not where you come across something that just won’t stick the first time around. While some concepts might take minutes for others to understand, you might scratch your head for two full days before it truly sinks in. But when it does.. You realize why it was worth it. It’s like being young, having a crush send you mixed signals, and then one day they finally tell you they like you. Different - A career in this field can sometimes make you wonder how 9–5 jobs even exist. You think to yourself I’ve spent 4 weeks on this problem and it doesn’t feel like I’ve made any progress. And then you compare it to a summer job you had when you were younger and recall that most jobs have an immediate turn around on value. They work to provide a service. Now I’m working to generate a solution and there is absolutely no standard on how long it might take. I would say that if any of this sounds intriguing to you then you should hop on the train.

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5]) 2. Probability and Statistics : A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc. 3. Applied Math + Algorithms : For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16]. 4. Distributed Computing : Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21]. 5. Expertise in Unix Tools : Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1]. 6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects : HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale. 7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques : feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though. Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all. Good luck.

If you become an ML expert you will have a lot of opportunities for yourself in leading MNCs and startups all over the world. Machine learning is an applied field, meaning that as an ML specialist you are expected to use ML as a tool and enhance different business process outcomes for your organization. There are many roles within an organization that you can assume in the capacity of someone that oversees the ML projects undertaken by the firm. I am describing some of the common ones below: ML Engineer In this role, you will be mainly tasked with the implementation of AI and ML algorithms across different projects. So you will be working on topics like predictive models for recommendation systems, image recognition systems, virtual assistants and chatbots, etc. You have to also identify which algorithms would be more suitable or efficient as compared to others for solving the same problem. For this, you need to know what constitutes a good ML model. You might also be involved in some R&D work in the creation of new products and services that would be based on such algorithms. Such a description would also hold true for other similar roles like AI and ML experts . 2. Data Scientist This is the most broad-based role in which you can be involved in this field. The duties of a data scientist encompass the duties of all other ML and AI-based roles. In addition to ML and AI-based projects, as a data scientist, you would be overseeing the entire data-driven decision-making in your particular team. You would be involved in a lot of different projects like predictive analytics, exploratory analysis of new markets, product launch forecasts, etc. You would be coordinating with people in other data-based roles and ensuring that the outcomes of the DS models are insightful for the organization. 3. NLP Engineer This is a role that is based on the overlap of ML algorithms, computational science, and human language. The main responsibility here is for you to develop algorithms that can recognize and respond to natural language as communicated by users. So this deals with a lot of linguistics, industry-specific requirements for engagement with customers and other users, along with data science. A lot of ML and AI jobs are also related to the automation of tasks across the organization and this could be encompassed under roles like AIOps Engineer, MLOps Engineer, etc. All of these career paths look very exciting and their demand and scope are increasing day by day with technological advancement and the digitization of all business sectors. If you want to make the most of this opportunity by pursuing a career in Machine Learning, you need to start by first acquiring a suitable Machine Learning certification. You need to look for a Machine Learning training program that helps you learn the subject in the proper business context. There is not much benefit to simply having an ML certificate which states that you know all the theories and coding. What you need is some certificates or other related projects in your resume which show that you have experience in actually solving business problems using ML. This can be done by getting project certifications in DS and ML. Project certifications make it evident that you have the knowledge of ML from a practical perspective and this makes them very helpful while applying for ML jobs. Another related thing that you need to keep in mind while working on ML projects for your profile is that they should all belong to a specific domain. Basically, you need to use ML projects to reflect industry expertise. Why is Domain Specialization required? You need to have domain specialization in order to be considered a worthy candidate for any ML job. I can explain this simply using an example - Suppose you are interested in applying as an ML Expert in a manufacturing & automobile firm like Toyota. You have worked on implementing DS and ML techniques to some problems in the automobile industry and you have worked on other related projects like forecasting car sales, demands, and prices, supply chain optimization for automobile manufacturing, etc. You are up against another candidate who does not have any such specific projects in their profile, they only have a generic data science/ML certification . Whose profile do you think is going to be more attractive to the recruiters at Toyota? Naturally, it will be your profile, as you already have relevant experience in their business domain. So you have to ensure you build your profile for an ML job after considering carefully which industry you want to work in, and then ensuring that you obtain a domain specialization in DS and ML within that industry. To that extent, I can suggest some courses which will be helpful in providing Domain specialization knowledge and project experience. My suggestions are as follows: Imarticus Learning The main features of the PG program in data analytics & ML from this institute are: The syllabus is taught with the help of case studies pertaining to specific industry problems. The placement program includes guaranteed interview opportunities. You will get guidance from industry experts on in-class projects. But, the major drawbacks are: The projects do not come with separate certifications, so you cannot specialize your ML learning. You cannot get a domain specialization from the course. The interview opportunities are not guaranteed to lead to jobs. This is not it. 2. Learnbay This institute offers the best Machine learning and data science course in Bangalore. It will teach you all the necessary skills and tools for ML through project-based learning if you choose to enroll in their Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program with Domain Specialization. I personally recommend this course over all others because of two main reasons: Project Certifications: Alongside the course completion certificate, you will also receive IBM certification for the capstone project. This course also provides micro-skills certifications as well. Domain Specialization: This is referring to the domain electives that you will choose during the course to streamline your learning of DS within a specific industry like Automotive, IoT and Embedded Domain, Development and Testing Domain, Sales, Marketing and HR Domain, etc . This feature is indispensable if you are thinking about a job after learning ML. Not only this, Learnbay also offers real-time projects on very important topics like Stock Price Prediction, Customer Review Analysis, Text Segmentation, etc. Working on these significantly enhances your understanding of ML and your ability to handle real-world problems in the subject. There is also an option of gaining a 100% job guarantee at Learnbay , by enrolling in the Data Science and AI with Job Guarantee program. If you do not get a job within 6 months of completing the course, you will be eligible for a 100% refund of the course fee . Apart from this also Learnbay has many beneficial features like free career counseling, 1-1 faculty sessions, mock interviews and resume prep, etc. Final Thoughts: So, to conclude, I would like to reiterate that if you are interested in an ML job what you need is the right learning track that lets you learn practically and gain an industry specialization. And according to me, Learnbay is the best place for that. You should explore all options thoroughly and make an informed decision. I wish you the best of luck."}
