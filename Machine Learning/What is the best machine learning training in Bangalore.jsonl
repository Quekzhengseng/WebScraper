According to the data, between 2018 and 2019, machine learning job roles received the most job listings (75%), followed by Deep Learning Engineers (61%), and Data Scientists (58%). Machine learning engineers have the greatest compensation, with take-home pay of $142,000 or higher. In India, the average compensation for ML engineers is 9.5 lakh per year. As the AI sector matures, we are witnessing an increase in distinct data science positions , with a high need for ML and deep learning engineers. There are many machine learning courses in Bangalore . However, ML is a job that makes you part of the bigger picture and hence demands expertise. Therefore, choose a course that gives in-depth training. How to find the right course? You could squander a lot of time looking for and piecing together learning materials/resources to supplement your work/educational background. There are several online courses on the same topic, but it is difficult to locate ones that include a project-based learning experience. Good Machine Learning courses are about more than simply content and resources; they are also about teaching approach and mentorship. Given the high dropout rate in online courses, mentorship is critical in keeping students motivated, dedicated, and on track. An important feature to look for in a machine learning course is domain specialization. There are a few courses that offer domain specialization in Bangalore. But why is domain specialization so important? Learning new skills requires focused attention, and Domain Specialization in Machine Learning (DSML) is the best approach to accomplish it. When it comes to recruiting, finding a course that focuses on a certain area of expertise is critical. This can help you acquire a paid job and expose you to other opportunities.

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

It's all about maths and proofing which I was not very familiar with (note I have a decent rank in GATECSIT). And due to the rush of the semester, you don't even get sufficient time to work out your weakness (although no amount of time is sufficient in this competitive world). It's not because it's happening in IISc, but because AI is all about maths and you gotta deal with it. So if you want a career in AI then this is the best course to opt for. The only advantage I got in this course work over other discipline students, was with Data Structure and Algorithm subject, which is a compulsory course for the AI course. But other than that you don't require much of CS skills (though we do a lot of coding here, and probably I am using my CS ninja skills there but somehow it's not noticeable to me). But if you are wondering if it is any easier for students from other disciplines ( AI is an Interdisciplinary program), then let me clear it right away NO! IT'S NOT. Even they are having their share of struggles. Sorry for diverting so much. Let's get you the taste of how difficult it gets. SCARE: You will be attending all classes regularly, but it will happen so often that you will be sitting like a dumb kid with no idea of whatsoever happening in the class (very often, so often that you can count the number of days, you completely understood, on the fingertips of your both hands... kidding! just a single hand is enough). RELIEF: The professors are so good at IISc that once you study their notes on your own, you will feel the magic of their teaching. I can't explain how beautiful their arguments of proofs can be. And eventually, you will start connecting the dots from the lectures which you never thought got into your memory. You will also be having the pleasure of fruitful discussions with some of the brightest students of India to help you with the syllabus. SCARE: Many times you will feel like, \"God! I should have joined CSA, that's what I am good at, not in this ugly multivariate calculus or statistics in N-dimensions.\" RELIEF: You meet your CSA friends with an intent to bitch about AI. But the first thing you hear from them, \"Bro, you know what! PSU was not bad either, should have joined when had the opportunity. Anyway, you AI guys are so lucky, got rid of the coding and still get to have a great placement.\" Then you both start crying together. Kidding! we cry in isolation. The problem is not with the course of AI or CSA but with the way we have trained our minds. Premium institutes like IISc and IITs do challenge this mindset and let you explore your potential to another level. This will hurt for sure but in the end, you will feel great about your self. I am on the verge of ending my second semester, having 8 plus CGPA, got an internship in a Big MNC, Trust me I don't regret my decision of choosing this Coursework at all. It's tough, real tough, you will feel helpless and depressed too sometimes but you will have a great company in that too and you will keep growing. You can never know if you are fit for this course, but if you get selected for it, then trust me you will fit well. I will end this answer by mentioning if you are taking the AI course then Maths will be your only friend, so be prepared to do lots of rigorous maths proofing. So if maths gives you nightmares or you start puking seeing linear algebra and probability, then this course is not for you. Other than this you will do fine. It's recommended to do an introductory course on machine learning to get the real flavor of what I am talking about ( which I never did before IISc, just did basic linear algebra from Gilbert Strang's MIT lectures). And one more thing these are just my personal opinions, and I in no sense represent my batch. So take all of these with a pinch of salt."}

Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

It is most decidedly NOT a branch of statistics, although I can understand the motivation of those who wish it were so. Certainly, that would simplify the field and make it more coherent, but it would also eliminate many aspects of the field that make it unique. If anything, I would argue that statistics is a subfield of ML, so the inclusion goes the other way. Machine learning, is simply put, the study of learning machines (reverse the words). It’s the (engineering) attempt to build artifacts that “learn”. Part of the problem here is that we haven’t defined what “learning” is. So, a good chunk of the past 30+ years have been on trying to define what “learning” is. We’re not past figuring that out yet! The people who do ML are a curious amalgam of computer scientists, neuroscientists, statisticians, biologists, philosophers, physicists, engineers, and thinkers of various sorts. Just attend a NIPS meeting, and you’ll see why. If anything, this defines the field. As Michael Jordan (U.C. Berkeley) put it once, ML is simply defined as the set of activities of this curious mixture of people who come to meetings like NIPS. That is what makes it special."}
