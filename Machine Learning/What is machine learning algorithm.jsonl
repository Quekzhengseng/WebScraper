An ML algorithm normally specifies the way the data is transformed from input to output and how the model learns the appropriate mapping from input to output. Thus ML algorithm = model + learning algorithm. The model specifies the mapping function and holds the parameters while the learning algorithm updates the parameters in an effort to help the model satisfy the objective. Examples of ML algorithms are: Linear regression which is about predicting a continuous value given the input. Like given the house dimensions, output the price. Artificial neural network (ANN) which is an ensemble of processing nodes arranged in a layer-by-layer manner. Logistic regression for two all more categories. It is essentially a single layered ANN where by each node in the layer represents a specific category in which the data can be classified. K means clustering which produces k centroids from the data. Agglomerative clustering which can produce a variable number of centroids depending on the cut off threshold. Self organizing map (SOM) which results in a map of neurons such that the neurons that are physically close together also fire on similar stimuli. This can resemble k means if the nodes are small in number. Support vector machine (SVM) which is about learning a maximum margin hyperplane. Kernel SVM which extends the linear maximum margin hyperplane to non-linearly separable problems using the kernel trick. And many more. An objective can be anything like minimizing the squared error between the desired and actual output values or more complex like picking up objects in robotic applications. But essentially complex objectives can be reduced to simpler ones for the sake of simplifying the training process. The aim of an learning algorithm is to ensure that the model is able to achieve the goal has accurately as possible. Thus in general in a supervised setting the objective is in the form: L ( x , y ; w ) = 1 n ∑ i l ( f ( x i ; w ) , y i ) L ( x , y ; w ) = 1 n ∑ i l ( f ( x i ; w ) , y i ) where f ( ) = f ( ) = the machine learning model specified by w w parameters and l ( ) = l ( ) = loss function which can be the cross-entropy, hinge-loss or squared error loss function. The ML model f ( ) f ( ) can be anything but in modern machine learning f ( ) f ( ) is normally implemented by a deep neural network (DNN) which is itself just a set of nested functions. For example, an n-layered DNN can be represented mathematically by: f ( x ; w ) = f n ( f n − 1 ( … f 2 ( f 1 ( x ; w 1 ) ; w 2 ) … ; w n − 1 ) ; w n ) f ( x ; w ) = f n ( f n − 1 ( … f 2 ( f 1 ( x ; w 1 ) ; w 2 ) … ; w n − 1 ) ; w n ) So we just transform the input first with layer 1 given by f 1 ( ) f 1 ( ) , then feed the result to layer 2 given by f 2 ( ) f 2 ( ) and so on up to the last layer who's output is the output of our function f ( ) f ( ) . Training such a model requires some tricks from optimization theory. In fact the idea is that we can reduce the error of the model if we can find the direction in which to update the weight parameters of each layer. That can be possible if we get the derivatives of the weights with respect to the objective L L and update the parameters using a gradient descent update rule given by: w ← w − λ ∂ L ∂ w w ← w − λ ∂ L ∂ w where λ = λ = learning rate The process may get stuck in a local minimum but it works in practice because many local minima traps are equivalent, that is, they yield similar small losses. Hope this helps."}

The following are the main categorization of learning algorithms: 1. Supervised Learning: In this setting, we provide a model a training data set, which consists of the data and the true labels. Given this data, a model is learnt. Obviously here, the more the data, the better the model will perform on unknown examples. Key factors here are that the model should generalize to unseen examples. Classification, Regression, Ranking fall under this learning paradigm. 2. Unsupervised Learning: In this setting, the model automatically organizes data without any labeled examples. Examples of this include Clustering of Data, Summarization etc. Data is organized based on the similarity of the data items. 3. Semi Supervised Learning: This is a hybrid between unsupervised and supervised, where some of the data is labeled, while a large pool of the data is actually unlabeled. Algorithms here take the entire labeled data, and intelligently use the unlabeled data to improve the model performance. 4. Online Learning/ Active Learning: In this paradigm, the algorithms keeps improving itself by using feedback of a human in the loop. Within each of these paradigms of learning, there are several different modeling techniques. Of course, before even getting to the modeling aspect (i.e. which machine learning model to use, one must choose the right set of features. This is called Feature engineering, and this often plays a significant role in getting good results. This also often requires domain expertise. Given the set of features, and the learning setting (whether supervised, online learning etc.), the next question is which ML model to use. The choice of this depends on the problem at hand. I segregate this into three kinds of models. 1. Deep Learning or Multilayer Neural Networks: Deep Neural Networks have found tremendous applicability, particularly given the large amount of compute and the large data sets we have these days. This is useful in several problem domains where it is very hard to hand craft features, for example, Image classification, Speech Recognition, Face recognition etc. Deep Learning models automatically learn the representation, or in other words do both the feature engineering and the modeling. For both these problems, there are several very common recipes and open source platforms available. 2. Ensembles and Decision Tree based Mo..."}

The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again.

Spam filters generally use machine-learning technique to find out spam emails and it put those emails in spam folder. Types of machine learning algorithms with examples: There are three types of machine learning: 1. Supervised learning 2. Unsupervised learning 3. Reinforcement learning 1. Supervised learning : In this machine-learning algorithm, both input data and output data are required. It contributes learning algorithm with known volume to support future judgement. Supervised learning has some limitations like, it only makes a judgement based on the given input and output. It cannot make a judgement for new information. Usually, this requires multiple iterations of each process to be able to perform accurate action. For example , if you train a machine to identify a ball. You need to provide data about the shape and colour and then the name of the object. Next time when you give a ball to that machine, it will check the data provided and identify it as a ball. 2. Unsupervised learning : In this machine-learning algorithm, no input or output data required. In addition, it allows the algorithm to execute an action without any guidance; the output is dependent on the algorithm. This learning technique can perform a more complex task and it is very unpredictable. For example , it you give a ball and a bat. It will first check the size, the colour of the object, and categorise according to this. Like this, it makes judgement. 3. Reinforcement learning : In this machine-learning algorithm, without training, the data machine has to make a judgement from experience only. In this, AI plays a game-like situation. Based on the wrong step and right step it gives a solution to a problem. For example , a self-driving car algorithm a programmer cannot predict everything that can happen on road and cannot put a lot of “if” condition. Therefore, in this case, the programmer can use the reinforcement-learning technique. Self-driving cars can make a judgement based on the wrong and right step."}
