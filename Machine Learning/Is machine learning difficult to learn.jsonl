Since so many people are talking about ML and learning ML, it cannot be an impossible task. On the other hand, it is also true that many people drop out of ML courses mid-way or are not able to complete their learning plan in ML because they get overwhelmed or find it too difficult. So what is the real picture? ML is actually one of the essential skills for working professionals to have. Regardless of what your background is and which field you work in, you will be able to advance in your career if you invest in learning ML techniques . This is because, owing to the big data boom and the rising importance of data-based decision making and code literacy, each and every organization is using ML models to support their business decisions and derive insights into their organizational processes. If you want to contribute to your job at this level, it is very important to be skilled in ML and data science. But ML is nothing to be afraid of. With the right approach and commitment , you can become an ML expert . Certainly, it is an entirely quantitative subject and is implemented using programming languages so you need to be thorough with both the theory and the coding side of it. But, the reason why I would still say that ML is actually a very manageable subject to learn is that it is closely linked with industry knowledge. You will have the complete context of how the various ML models work, how they are applied, and how to make sense of them when you can relate it at every step to your own background and experience. So let us break down the approach to learning ML into simple steps: Step 1: Cover the theory Firstly, you have to spend ample time learning the data science foundations that ML is based on. This refers to the various statistical techniques and concepts which form the base of data science and ML. Start with descriptive statistics and elementary mathematical techniques like linear algebra, analytical geometry, etc. Then you can slowly build your way up to inferential statistics and predictive models like regression, clustering, classification, etc. Step 2: Learn to program Once you have learned these concepts thoroughly you should proceed with the second step which is to learn how to apply these ideas to an actual dataset using a coding platform like Python or R. This would also include learning how to preprocess data in SQL and visualize outcomes of the ML models in Tableau. You have to keep in mind that you will not be able to become an expert in programming in one shot. It needs constant practice and an open mind that helps you learn from your mistakes. With this mindset, you can certainly become comfortable with coding for ML. Step 3: Match it with industry knowledge This is the most important step, especially if you are keen on learning ML skills from a job perspective . It is naturally easy for us to learn quantitative techniques once we have already used them to solve some problems. It is the same with ML. Your journey of learning ML will become very smooth if you complement it with project-based learning and domain specialization. Project-based learning and Domain Specialization: Why should you focus on project-based learning? Simply knowing how to run some codes for some ML models is not enough to train you to face actual problems in the field. If you do not work on some real-time projects in ML you will not know how to make sense of everything that you have learned. Even beyond that, if you want your ML learning to be helpful while applying for jobs, you need to make sure you have separate project certifications in ML. This will show that you have experience in solving actual business problems with ML which is very important for recruiters. It will help you strengthen your understanding of the subject. Why should you focus on domain specialization? There are two reasons why you should do this. Firstly, if you work on datasets and use examples from the industry about which you already have the knowledge, it will help you relate your learning of ML to a proper context and it will seem much easier to you. Second, a domain specialization is actually mandatory if you want a good ML job. You will be considered for a position only when your knowledge of ML is streamlined within the industry of the company that you are applying to. This is because it is only such domain knowledge that can convince the recruiters that you can contribute to business value using ML, and you are not just some generic technical person. In order to have a good learning experience with ML, make sure you choose the right ML course . It can also be learned through a data science certification as that encompasses both foundational data science concepts and ML modeling. You can consider the following institutes for this: Simplilearn The main features of the ML certification at this institute are: Online boot camp-based learning. Mentoring from industry experts. Completion of in-course case studies and projects. The main drawbacks are: Does not provide a Job guarantee. No domain specialization. 2. Learnbay I've finally located the ideal organization that can resist both of these scenarios thanks to my extensive investigation. The Learnbay Data Science/Machine Learning Institute is a leading provider of high-quality Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program with IBM domain expertise and certifications . In my view this institute is better than the others, because of its following features: Along with a certificate for course completion, you get individual project certifications from IBM for each of the capstone projects completed by you in the program. You may also get a certificate for micro-skills projects as well. You can benefit from learning through real-time projects on many relevant topics like Stock Price Prediction, Speech Recognition, Text Analytics, etc. Industry-related work can help you obtain experience in this subject. Using machine learning methods, you'll discover more about the training of models and the creation of new models. As a result, you get two advantages: first, you receive hands-on experience , and second, you obtain IBM-certified projects. You will be able to customize your DS and ML learning within an industry of your choice by choosing domain electives in it. This will give you a domain specialization . You can choose any domain like Cloud and DevOps, Automotive, IoT and Embedded, Development and Testing, etc. If you want a job guarantee after the course you should consider the Data Science and AI with Job Guarantee course at Learnbay. It is also supported by a 100% money-back assurance if you do not have a job within 6 months after completing the course. You have many other features to benefit from like free career counseling, live and interactive learning, a flexible subscription period for the course , etc. So with that, I will stop my answer. I hope you are convinced that if you are in the right program, then learning ML is really not difficult. I suggest you choose Learnbay for this as it has an understanding of what you need in order to have a fruitful learning journey with ML. Thank you."}
