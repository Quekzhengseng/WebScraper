Here are some of my top few algorithms and models: Most elegant: The Perceptron algorithm . Developed back in the 50s by Rosenblatt and colleagues, this extremely simple algorithm can be viewed as the foundation for some of the most successful classifiers today, including suport vector machines and logistic regression, solved using stochastic gradient descent. The convergence proof for the Perceptron algorithm is one of the most elegant pieces of math I’ve seen in ML. Most useful: Boosting , especially boosted decision trees. This intuitive approach allows you to build highly accurate ML models, by combining many simple ones. Boosting is one of the most practical methods in ML, it’s widely used in industry, can handle a wide variety of data types, and can be implemented at scale. I recommend checking out XGBoost for really scalable implementation of boosted trees . Boosting also lends itselft to very elegant proofs. Biggest comeback: Convolutional neural network deep learning This type of neural network has been around since the early 80s. Although there was a decline in interest in them from the late nineties to late 2000s, they have seen an amazing comeback in the last 5 years. In particular, convolutional neural networks form the core of the deep learning models that have been having a huge impact, especially in computer vision and speech recognition. Most beautiful algorithm: Dynamic programming (e.g., Viterbi , forward-backward, variable elimination & belief propagation algorithms). Dynamic programming is one of the most elegant algorithmic techniques in computer science, since it allows you to search through an exponentially-large space to find the optional solution. This idea has been applied in various ways in ML, especially for graphical models, such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks and Markov networks. Unbeatable baseline: Nearest-neighbor algorithm. Often, when you are trying to write a paper, you want to show that “your cuve is better than my curve”. :) One way to do that is to introduce a baseline approach, and show that your method is more accurate. Well… nearest-neighbor is the simplest baseline to implement, so often folks will try first, thinking they’ll easily beat it and show their method is awesome. To their surprise, nearest-neighbor can be extremely hard to beat! In fact, if you have enough data, nearest neighbor is extremely powerful! And, this method is really useful in practice."}

I know that in the day and age of Deep Learning this seems to be a really odd answer. So let’s start with a bit of background: In 1995–1998 I was using neural networks, 1998–2002 I was working mostly with tree based methods and from 2002 on, logistic regression (and linear models in general including quantile regression, Poisson regression, etc.) ended up to slowly make its way into my heart. In 2003 I published a paper in Machine Learning showing the results on comparing tree based methods against logistic regression on 35 (at the time large) datasets. The short answer (if you want to skip the 30 pages) - if the signal to noise ratio is high, trees tend to win. But, if you have very noisy problems and the best model has an AUC<0.8 - logistic beats the trees almost always. Ultimately not very surprising: if the signal is too weak, high variance models get lost in the weeds. So what does this mean in practice? The type of problems I tend to deal with are super noisy with low level of predictability. Think of it in the terms of deterministic (chess) all the way to random (supposedly the stock market). Some problems are just more predictable (given the data you have) than others. And this is not a question of the algorithms but rather a conceptual statement about the world. Most problems I am interested in are very close to the stock market end of the spectrum. Deep learning is really great on the other end - “Is this picture showing a cat?”. In the world of uncertainty, the bias variance tradeoff still often ends up being favorable on the side of more bias - meaning, you want a ‘simple’ very constrained model. And this is where logistic regression comes in. I personally have found it much easier to ‘beef up’ a simple linear model by adding complicated features than trying to constrain a very powerful (high variance) model class. In fact each and every one of the data mining competitions I have won (KDD CUP 07–09) used a linear model. Beyond the performance - linear models are robust and tend to need much less handholding (ok, fine, stochastic gradient descent and penalties make it a bit harder). This is extremely important when you want to do predictive modeling in industry where you do not have the luxury to spend 3 month on building the perfect model. And finally, I have a better chance of maybe understanding what is going on from a linear model."}

Before spilling the beans, I want to make some parenthetical comments on how to do impactful research in ML (or any other field), since this bias colors my answer. Resist the temptation to scroll to the bottom to see my answer! Trust me, the long prelude is worth reading whether you are a beginning student learning the basics or a seasoned researcher in machine learning. In a lifetime of giving talks on ML over dozens of countries and every conceivable venue and audience, I have found it is perhaps the least well known method. It’s worth repeating that the greatest and most enduring ideas are simple by their nature. For example, Darwin’s principle of natural selection is more than 150 years old. It is the most impactful idea in biology. It has survived virtually every test thrown at it over the years, from multi-decade long observations of closed ecosystems (read the brilliant Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Beak of the Finch” by Jonathan Weiner that chronicles the story of a group of biologists that have spent each summer for more than 30 years on a hot lonely volcanic rock of an island in the Galapagos measuring survival rates of various species of finches) to studies of the evolution of bacterial colonies in Petri dishes and DNA comparisons of related species. The principle of natural selection is simple enough that it can be taught to high school students. Yet, its implications are so profound for man as a species that even today 150 years after its publication and subsequent confirmation, no Presidential candidate or sitting President in the US would dare to openly declare his (or her) belief in evolution. To do so would be political suicide, as the candidate would likely lose the votes of millions of Americans who even today refuse to believe in evolution. It is a testament to the power of Darwin’s idea that it is simultaneously so universal as it is controversial. People would rather believe in black holes or even time travel. So, we need to find an ML algorithm that is simple enough to be as powerful as Darwin’s idea, yet be elementary enough to be taught in high school without using any or much math. Needless to say, this immediately rules out most of the competition. Almost every paper published in NIPS or ICML over the last decade is riddled with baroque math, and fails to make the grade. We also need to find a method that addresses a problem that is deep enough that it applies not just to humans, but also potentially many other species. One such problem is the acquisition of learned behaviors. Darwin solved the problem of adaptation over the multi-million year history of life in earth (and other planets— even though we haven’t yet found life on other planets, when we do, like the universal laws of physics, it is very likely that extraterrestrial life will be governed by Darwin’s principle). What’s left for machine learning is to explain how individual organisms learn behavior from their own experiences. It’s very satisfying to me that my favorite machine learning algorithm is also the oldest algorithm that was implemented in computer software, and at this point, the only machine learning algorithm that has been intensively studied in animal brains and found to hold true. It is also the algorithm responsible for the most recent spectacular demonstration of ML, confirming its longevity over six decades. If I had to rewrite my learned colleague Pedro Domingo’s book “The Master Algorithm”, this would be my choice of a method. Now, it only remains for me to open the curtain and reveal my answer: temporal-difference (TD) learning. TD learning was first discovered (or perhaps rediscovered since the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard had the basic intuition in the 1800s) and used in the first machine learning program ever written by IBM researcher Arthur Samuel in the late 1950s to enable a computer to learn the game of checkers from self-play with no human providing training examples. Arthur Samuel coined the term “machine learning”. In 2017, 60 years after Samuel, researchers at Google (Alphabet?) Deep Mind used TD learning to beat the reigning Go world champion in what was considered the hardest human game for a computer to learn. The most recent version AlphaGo Zero learned entirely from self play, unlike the earlier AlphaGo variant, and handily trounced the latter. More than any previous AI demonstration, AlphaGo convinced the Chinese leadership of the true power of AI, and caused a radical reshuffle of that country’s research priorities into putting many billions of dollars into AI. Till today, TD learning remains the most well studied algorithm in the brain, and a basic theoretical framework of hundreds of neuroscientists who study how the animal and insect brain learns from rewards. It has been tested on monkey brains and insect brains like the honeybee. We know now how TD learning is implemented in the brain, what brain structures are involved, and what neurotransmitters are involved (dopamine). While the algorithm is remarkably simple and can be coded up in a few lines in simple problems, its mathematical analysis has taken several decades to complete. The early original version does not converge reliably. Rich Sutton, who after Arthur Samuel has contributed the most to TD learning for over three decades beginning with his 1984 PhD thesis at UMass Amherst, proposed a more stable “gradient TD” algorithm about 10 years ago. I’m delighted to say that together with my former PhD student Bo Liu, we were able to show that the newer gradient TD is essentially solving a saddle point problem in a dual optimization space, thereby opening the door to the first finite sample mathematical proof for the convergence for the gradient form of TD. Sadly, our work uses far too advanced math to be taught even to very bright undergraduates. Most CS grad students, unless specially trained in optimization and stochastic approximation theory would not understand our paper. To me, it was a personal triumph to cap 25 years of study of reinforcement learning with being able to shed deeper light on its most widely used method. Yet, I don’t kid myself that our theoretical work will achieve any kind of popularity. Simplicity always wins. My most cited paper remains a journal paper in the Artificial Intelligence journal published in 1992 that showed perhaps for the first time that robots could learn from their own behavior using TD learning. In robotics, it was a breakthrough in that it showed how to get self learning robots. Robot learning research using TD continues today 25 years later in many universities, research labs, and companies, with more impressive demonstrations like self flying helicopters. In summary, for being the first algorithm that started the field of machine learning in the 1950s to being the method that was used in the most recent spectacular demonstration in 2017 of the power of machine learning that swayed the research priorities of the world’s second largest economy, to being the most well established biologically understood method in the brain, and for being possibly the simplest such method with these attributes, I declare TD learning to be my favorite machine learning method. I must end on a sadder note. To me, it is inexplicable that TD learning is not included in most if not all the currently popular ML textbooks. It’s a crying shame that such a beautiful method, one that I might add computer scientists can proudly claim as their own and not stolen from statistics, is so woefully ignored. It reflects on the part of the textbook writers very poor judgement. Fortunately, the brilliant classic text on reinforcement learning by my long term UMass colleague Andrew Barto with his former PhD student Rich Sutton is highly readable and has been cited more than 25,000 times on Google Scholar. Just pause to reflect on this absurdity. The text on RL is cited hands down much more often than any other ML textbook, or in fact, any other ML publication. Yet, its central algorithm —TD learning — is ignored in all ML textbooks used today. To get back to my analogy with Darwin, it is as if a textbook on biology was written that didn’t include a long section on natural selection. It would be laughed at. I hope future textbook writers will heed my words! I end with a quote from my favorite poem in the English language by the immortal John Keats, called “An Ode to a Grecian Urn”. “Beauty is Truth, and truth beauty. That is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know”. TD learning is beautiful because it is true, and true because it is such a sublimely beautiful and powerful method that has served the ML community for over six decades. If you are one of the many in my experience who don’t know TD learning, if this note encourages you to learn it, it will be ample reward for my labors in writing it. It may prove to be the best one hour you spend in your lifetime, as it was for me when I first learned TD way back in 1989. Remember to keep in mind that the simplest ideas are always the most consequential in the end. Thanks for reading this overly long reply!

Why is it my favorite? Because it brings together some of the most fascinating areas of mathematics in an interesting way. I’ve never seen an algorithm combine so many ideas and insights from seemingly disparate fields. So, what is Spectral Clustering? It is an algorithm for detecting communities among a network of entities (users in a social network, pixels in an image, gene expressions etc.). The goal is to partition the entities into groups such that entities of the group are similar while the entities of different groups are not similar. (Detecting communities in a social network. Source ) How does Spectral Clustering work? First, we construct a similarity matrix from the given network (or graph). Then we extract the most relevant eigenvectors of the similarity matrix using eigenvalue decomposition and use it to derive a new ‘spectral’ representation for the entities in our network. Finally, we perform k-means on the new representation and output the clusters. To be honest, the first time I came across spectral clustering, I had no idea why this method should give a nice partition of the network . There’s just too much going on, and it definitely is not intuitive at the first glance. But if you stick with it and dig a little deeper, you begin to see some surprising connections. Here, I’ll just try to list a few tidbits about spectral clustering to pique your curiosity. Graph Cuts: It is a well known fact that finding the balanced minimum cut of a graph is an NP hard problem [2] . It turns out that spectral clustering solves a continuous relaxation of this discrete combinatorial optimization problem. Random Walks: Consider a random walk on a graph [3] . At each time step, the random walker jumps from the current vertex to any of its neighbors randomly. It turns out that spectral clustering minimizes the inter-cluster transit time (the time spent walking between the clusters rather than within the clusters) of the random walker. Physics: Spectral clustering has surprising connections to the Laplacian operator [4] that is widely used in physics as a measure of smoothness of a surface. Graph Signal Processing [5] : Consider a graph signal on the given network that distinctly identifies the best possible clustering of its vertices. Spectral clustering minimizes the total variation of this indicator graph signal. Matrix Perturbation Theory: Consider an ideal similarity matrix constructed by a graph with disjoint clusters. It turns out that perturbing this idea matrix by adding a ‘few’ edges across the clusters does little to change the spectral representation of the vertices. Hence, spectral clustering works, and is immune to ‘noise’. ..and I could go on and on. Unlike the hottest machine learning algorithms these days (neural networks and deep learning) which are basically black boxes where no one understands why something works, spectral methods have strong theoretical grounding with several interpretations on why they work. I like to think of spectral clustering as a well written poem that means different things to different people while being elegant all the same.

Machine learning is both an art and a science. When it comes to machine learning algorithms, there is no one-size-fits-all solution or approach. Several factors can influence your decision to use a machine learning algorithm. Some problems are extremely specific and necessitate a one-of-a-kind solution. A recommender system, for example, is a very common type of machine learning algorithm that solves a very specific type of problem. Other problems, on the other hand, are very open and require a trial-and-error approach. Supervised learning, classification, and regression, for example, are all very open. They could be used to detect anomalies or to build more general types of predictive models. Furthermore, some of the decisions we make when selecting a machine learning algorithm are more concerned with business decisions than with optimization or technical aspects of the algorithm. We'll look at some of the factors that can help you narrow down your search for a machine learning algorithm in the sections below. Note- Before you start looking at different ML algorithms, you should have a good understanding of your data, problem, and constraints. Understand what kind of data you have- The type and quality of data we have influences which algorithm we use. Some algorithms can work with small sample sets, while others require massive amounts of data. Certain algorithms are designed to work with specific types of data. For example, Naive Bayes works well with categorical input but is completely unaffected by missing data. How to know your data? Examine the summary statistics and visualizations (Percentiles, Average, Medians, and Correlations) Make a data visualization (Box Plots, Density plots, histograms, Scatter plots) Cleaning Data- Address the issue of missing value. Some models are more affected by missing data than others. Even models that deal with missing data can be affected by it. Determine what to do with outliers. Outliers in multidimensional data can be quite common. Some models are more prone to outliers than others. Tree models are typically less sensitive to the presence of outliers. Outliers can, however, have an impact on regression models or any model that attempts to use equations. Outliers can be the result of poor data collection or legitimately extreme values. Augment the Data- The process of transforming raw data into data that is ready for modeling is known as feature engineering. Different models may have different engineering requirements for features. Some have feature engineering built-in. Categorize the Problem- Categorize by input: A supervised learning problem is one that has labeled data. Unsupervised learning is used when you have unlabeled data and want to find structure. It's a reinforcement learning problem if you want to optimize an objective function by interacting with the environment. Categorize based on output. It's a regression problem if the output of your model is a number. It's a classification problem if the output of your model is a class. It's a clustering problem if your model's output is a set of input groups. Do you want to find an anomaly? That is called anomaly detection. Understand your constraints- What is the size of your data storage capacity? Is it necessary for the prediction to be done faster? Is it necessary to learn faster? Etc. Find the Algorithms- Now that you know where you stand, you can use the tools at your disposal to identify the algorithms that are applicable and practical to implement. Some of the factors influencing model selection include: Whether or not the model meets the business objectives How much pre-processing is required for the model How accurate is the model? The model's explainability The model's speed: How long does it take to build a model, and how long does it take the model to predict? The model's scalability Commonly Used ML Algorithms- Linear Regression Logistic Regression Decision Trees K-means Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Support Vector Machines (SVM) Naive Bayes Random Forest Neural Networks How to learn ML Algorithms? Tutort Academy offers Data Science, AI, and ML courses for working professionals. They provide numerous unique real-time case studies in the field of Health Care, BFSI, Fraud Detection, Sales, Transportation, etc, that will not only help you to learn but also will be outstanding for your portfolio.

The small batch size ensures that you have great interactivity with the mentors ( all are from top-tier companies with great expertise). Since the classes are 100% live, this ensures greater interactivity. Conclusion- In general, you can use the points above to shortlist a few algorithms, but it is difficult to predict which algorithm will work best right away. It is usually preferable to work in iterations. Throw your data into the ML algorithms you identified as potential good approaches, run them all in parallel or serial, and finally evaluate the performance of the algorithms to select the best one (s)."}

I also think it’s amazing that the trick of dividing the weights by two does such a good job of approximating the prediction of the ensemble. I don’t know of any theoretical reason why it should work so well in deep nonlinear models, but it does."}
