In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless.

Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

Placement assistance is quite good but only available for a limited time. Assignment quality and feedback process are the best features of Scaler academy Data science, an ML program. Upgrad - Course : Executive Post Graduate Program in AI and ML How to take entry to the course : Direct application through aptitude test followed by personal interview. Fees of the course: approx 3 lakh INR. Key highlight:- 12-month recorded video-based but instructor-led online learning. Course modules are highly industry competent with continuous updates. High quality graded assessment with timely feedback. Strict project and assignment submission deadlines. Case study-based learning. Bi-weekly interactive sessions for quality resolution. Industry demanding capstone project but with the less personalised guidelines. Basic programming and coding knowledge are required. 12-hours technical support (9 am to 9 pm). Integrated hiring drive and expert guidance profile building service but for a limited period of time. IIT-Bangalore certification. Simplilearn - Courses : Masters Program in AI engineering, Post Graduate Program in Ai and ML How to take entry to the course: Direct application through aptitude test followed by personal interview. Fees of the course: approx 2.3 lakh INR for Post Graduate Program and 50,000 INR for Masters Program. Key highlight:- World’s no one Bootcamp course provider. Excellent course designing Effective placement supports. Coding skill honing through hackathon events. Flexible learning schedule with additional interactive ‘ask m anything ’ sessions. Masters programs are quite pocket friendly, but PG programs offer better capstone project support. Basic knowledge of programming required. My recommendation : For working professionals with 1+ years of experience, I would recommend Learnbay courses . The main reason for such recommendation is their elective domain modules, which are key to a lucrative and sustainable data science career switch. Even non-programmers can find suitable courses here. But the only thing you need is to manage apparent time for live and interactive classes. If you can't manage this in any way, then Simplilearn becomes the best alternative. Things to keep in mind while choosing a course- Interactive live classes offer the best learning outcomes. Capstone projects are the key to a successful AI and ML career. Always check for the level and quality of guidance for the same. If you own more than two years of experience, it is better to limit the course fees experience up to 1 lakhs INR. Go for domain-specific studies. Never fall for the university certification tag- recruiters don’t care about the certification tag. Best of luck."}

The learners who want to pursue their masters and have a desire for research in ML and AI can opt for the college courses. For this you have to clear the national level examination known as GATE with a very good rank under 500. This will help you to secure a good college for your masters program. Some of the best colleges which you will get are all IITs, NITs and IIITs. Though there are many other private and CFTIs colleges that offer courses for ML and AI but I won’t suggest you to go with them as they are not worth it as ML and AI are trending new technical skills whose course curriculum are not designed in a good way in private and CFTIs colleges. The course fees for the two year duration in IITs, NITs and IIITs will land you approx. over 5-6 lacs. Moreover, in many colleges you will need to clear the written test and interview part so be prepared for that. Who can enroll in a training course? All working professionals whose aim is to either get a good job or want to make a career transition in top companies in a job oriented short term course curriculum can enroll themselves in the training institute courses. In training courses, you will learn everything about ML and AI in designated duration as per the current industry demands unlike the 2 year rigorous masters program. Moreover, the learners who are not able to clear the GATE exam and have financial restrictions can also harness their ML and AI skills from the training courses. What is my suggestion? I will highly suggest you to fully learn ML and AI from training courses rather than going for a masters program because of the following reasons: Extra years of study and burden: Many of my friends enrolled in the masters program in good IITs and IIITs which they left the course program because of the extra burden of research work which restricted their exposure. Yes, there are many students who drop out from the masters program because of the high research work in top colleges especially in the IITs in which they were unable to match up with the other peers. Also, the devotion of a full 2 years in a masters program is very difficult. Highly competitive entrance exam of GATE: The GATE exam is very difficult in nature in which you have to prepare the 10 subjects of your engineering branch with the addition of two other subjects engineering mathematics and general aptitude. This sums up 12 subjects which requires one to learn the concepts, make the notes, revise the concepts, solve the previous year questions, solve practice questions, give test series and analysis which is very difficult and can’t be done by everyone. Very high course fees for 2 year duration: Top IITs fees are affordable in nature while that of new IITs, all NITs and all IIITs fees are very high which is not economical in nature. Hence, it is better to proceed your learning of ML and AI through training institute courses which are offered by top training institutes such as Tutort Academy which will help you to learn ML and AI from India’s best minds with greater affordability, flexibility and 100% placement guaranteed support. Some of the best features which you will be allotted at Tutort Academy are: Structured courses In depth Curriculum Personalized Mentorship Domain Specialization High Quality Study Materials Access to Challenges and Competitions , etc Out of the above mentioned features, the institute offers two very best features which are: Flexible Pass Since, ML and AI fields are majorly pursued by the working professionals and so is the courses of Tutort Academy therefore, as a working professional, you may face sometimes difficulty in your learning process because of your busy schedules and here the flexible pass will help you to learn all your missed concepts and refine your previous concepts though LMS portal anytime.
