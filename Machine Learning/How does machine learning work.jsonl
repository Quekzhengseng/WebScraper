Alright, let’s start from the basics. What is machine learning?

For example, let’s say you want to program a program to play a game- chess (or Go). There are two fundamentally different ways to go about programming such a bot.

What is machine learning? The high level and most commonly accepted definition is: machine learning is the ability for computers to learn and act without being explicitly programmed. For example, let’s say you want to program a program to play a game- chess (or Go). There are two fundamentally different ways to go about programming such a bot. The first approach is to explicitly program the instructions your bot will take. If the board is in a certain configuration (state), move your knight to B4. Or if the board is in another state, move your pawn to C4. This hard-coded method isn’t particularly practical or appealing since it is near-impossible for the programmer to consider all of the possible scenarios beforehand. The second approach is to simply program your bot with the rules of chess. Then, let the bot play thousands of games and let it decide which moves to make given a certain configuration. You can reward it when it wins or punish it when it loses, so it “learns” which moves are “good” by rewarding them. For the game of chess, the input would be a board configuration (X) and the output would be your bot’s next move (Y). Hopefully, after training, your bot will have found the function that outputs the best move (Y), given a certain game configuration (X). Remember that a function is just a relationship between an input and output. However, the key takeaway is that the bot is not hard-coded to output anything . All the moves it makes is “learned” through training. The chess example above falls under Reinforcement Learning, which is a branch of Machine Learning. The other branches include Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. Supervised learning is when you have knowledge of the input (X) and the output (Y), then you “supervise” the program in predicting the right outcome via trial and error. An example would be predicting house prices: Input X: 10,000 houses- you know the area, city, and age of each house Output Y (known): 10,000 house prices You want to find the function that can most accurately predict the house price (Y) given the various inputs (X). Unsupervised learning is when you have zero knowledge of the output and you want to try to find patterns or groupings within the data. Think clustering: Input X: a city Output Y(unknown): most densely populated areas You want to find the mapping from a city (X) to the most densely populated areas (Y). Some more examples can be found in the picture below. Conclusion At the core of every machine learning algorithm, all the algorithm is trying to do is find a relationship from the input X to the output Y. How exactly it finds this function varies by the algorithm. But almost all algorithms require a lot of computations. And a lot of revisions. And usually a good amount of data. For a basic example, I point you here . Happy learning. P.S. As a side note, one of the main reasons Deep Learning has been doing extremely well is that Neural Networks have been proven to be an Universal Function Approximater, meaning that it can approximate any function between X or Y- given enough data of course."}

It's the idea that computers can learn without human input and come up with new knowledge for themselves. You may have heard about machine learning before, maybe about Netflix recommending movies or Amazon suggesting products based on your browsing history. How does machine learning operate? Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of machine learning trains computers to think like people do by learning from and improving upon prior experiences. It uses little to no human intervention and operates by examining data and recognizing patterns. Machine learning can automate almost any task that can be carried out using a data-defined pattern or set of rules. This enables businesses to automate tasks that, in the past, could only be completed by humans, such as taking customer service calls, maintaining books, and reviewing resumes. Machine learning mostly employs two methods: You can gather data or create a data output from an earlier ML deployment with supervised learning . Because supervised learning functions very similarly to how people actually learn, it is fascinating. When performing supervised tasks, we provide the computer with a set of labeled data points known as a training set. 2. You can discover a wide range of unidentified patterns in data using unsupervised machine learning. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm uses only unlabeled instances to try to uncover some underlying structure in the data. The goal of clustering is to organize data points into meaningful groups in which the components are related to one another but distinct from those of other clusters. Market segmentation is one task where clustering is advantageous. In order to facilitate better interpretation, dimension reduction models group comparable or associated qualities to reduce the number of variables in a dataset (and more effective model training).

Machine learning has become increasingly complicated as a result of basic experiments. How does machine learning work? Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that trains computers to think as humans do: by learning from and improving on past experiences. It operates by analyzing data and discovering patterns with little human participation. Machine learning can automate almost any operation that can be accomplished using a data-defined pattern or set of rules. This enables businesses to automate operations previously only performed by humans, such as customer support, bookkeeping, and resume evaluation. Machine learning employs two primary techniques: You can use supervised learning to acquire data or generate a data output from a previous ML deployment. Supervised learning is fascinating because it operates in a similar fashion to how humans learn. Unsupervised machine learning allows you to discover previously unseen patterns in data. With only unlabeled instances, the algorithm attempts to learn some intrinsic structure to the data in unsupervised learning. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are two frequent unsupervised learning tasks. Machine learning has many applications, from automating tedious manual data entry to more complex use cases like insurance risk assessments or fraud detection. These include client-facing functions like customer service, product recommendations (see Amazon's product suggestions or Spotify's playlisting algorithms), and internal applications within organizations to help speed up processes and reduce manual workloads. It is evident that machine learning is a career with immense growth potential . Learning the trade can only benefit you. There are many machine learning courses available today. You can join one and build an awesome career. One of the most popular machines learning courses is offered by Udacity .

Machine learning is a very broad term and simply means methods of giving a computer known input-output relations and getting it to predict the output given new, unknown inputs. If I'm honest, when I first learned how a neural network worked, I was a little disappointed because there's no magic: it's just a generalization of linear regression fitting. Most machine learning techniques are essentially statistical in nature. Here I will explain how a neural network works because it is one of the most common and basic methods. First, you have a set of known, input-output relations. To express this mathematically, you could say that → x i → y i x → i → y i where i goes from 1 to n . Note that the inputs are vectors whereas the output is scalar. To deal with vector outputs, you can train multiple models. The above mapping is called the training data . Next, you have a function that takes an input in the same form and returns an output, also in the same form. This function should have two properties: it is nonlinear and it has a series of coefficients which can be varied so as to emulate a variety of other functions. Again, expressing this mathematically: y = f ( → x , → k ) y = f ( x → , k → ) where k is a vector of coefficients. We need to vary these coefficients so that the function f , or model , returns y values as close to those in the above mapping, given the corresponding input x values, as possible. Thus we need to train it by varying the coefficients and feeding both the results from f and the training data to a cost function which measures the goodness of fit . Lets express the cost function as follows: C [ f ( → x i , → k ) , y i ] C [ f ( x → i , k → ) , y i ] So we are feeding both the results of the model, given the inputs, and the known outputs to C and getting back only a single result which measures the goodness of fit. Note that we need to feed all of the training data to the cost function, thus it has 2* n parameters. We need to minimize C with respect to the coefficients, k . This is typically expressed as follows: min → k C [ f ( → x i , → k ) , y i ] min k → C [ f ( x → i , k → ) , y i ] The most common form of C is a sum of squares: C = ∑ n i = 1 [ f ( → x i ) − y i ] 2 C = ∑ i = 1 n [ f ( x → i ) − y i ] 2 Making this a least squares problem. For brevity, I've omitted the coefficients from f . Because f is non-linear, there is usually no closed-form solution to the minimization problem, and we must solve it by an iterative, numerical algorithm. I won't go into much detail about minimization algorithms because this is a huge and diverse field, however to get a flavour of how these things work, you might want to look up Newton's method , which is easy to generalize to multiple dimensions. Another important method is gradient descent . There are no good, general methods for multidimensional minimization and it is impossible to guarantee a global minimum except for a narrow subset of well-behaved problems. Stable methods are typically slow while faster methods tend to be unstable, so many of the best methods will combine a slow, stable method with a fast, unstable one, e.g. when things are going well, take a Newton step, while if the solution veers off, switch to gradient descent."}

Sometimes the models are hidden or implied, especially when they are composed of the data itself. An example of this is the k-nearest neighbour method, where an answer for an input is found by a distance function to other data points that are the nearest neighbours. In that case, the hard part of the ML task was to define the metric - the definition of closeness - out of a space of such measures. This is used often in machine learning to reduce the complexity of the raw problem into a more tractable problem."}
