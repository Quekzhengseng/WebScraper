So, it gave me a thought of writing this answer. Let’s start.. First of all, leave the terms artificial and machine aside . We will try to understand the words intelligence and learning one-by-one. So, what do you mean by intelligence? Let me explain that with a example of a short conversation between two persons. (Pardon, as I am very bad at social conversations) Person A: Hey friend, I am in such a bad situation and I can’t think of a solution. Can you help? Person B (giving a solution): You can do ‘this’ in order to get out of this situation. Person A (thinking how intelligent Person B is): Thank you so much.. Ever thought when you call someone intelligent? Its when they can solve something which is very hard (or you can’t), right? A ‘bad situation’ is often referred to as a ‘problem’. So, here’s the point.. One who can solve a complex/hard problem is intelligent . Now, think of how one can solve a given (mathematical and not real life) problem. There are two possibilities - either Method 1: he/she/it has solved such a problem before and has learned how to solve such problems or Method 2: (it is first time he/she/it faced this type of problem and) he/she/it is actually intelligent to think of possibilities of how to solve the problem based on what he/she/it knows , right? The former is called learning and the latter is called knowledge (along with intelligence). So, in short, to solve a problem, one needs either of these two. Hence, learning is a part of intelligence . The latter here, which describes knowledge can’t be achieved in machines and you know the reason for this. I assumed that the problem is mathematical i.e. computational and not a real life problem. There are two reasons for this: Real life always brings to you new problems and hence you need to solve them using the second method which needs knowledge and intelligence (and I needed to define the term learning ) . Machines can only do computations and that’s why it is called a computer . Now, first take the term machine under consideration. We need to make machines learn and hence it is said machine learning . And at last about the term artificial, that is something not natural . Natural intelligence means that one gets intelligence when he/she/it was first created, right? Artificial intelligence means that someone needs to add intelligence to that entity after it is created. (Think of it as adding ingredients to your creation). Now, that the two terms are clear, you have the answer. As learning is a part of intelligence, machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence . Also, machine learning is the core part of artificial intelligence as method 2 doesn’t work on machines/computers yet .. You may also share your ideas so that I can learn something from it.. Thanks."}

Machine Learning (ML) is one of the two branches of artificial intelligence and has seen significant growth in recent years. Some of the main differences between Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are: Machine Learning is one of the two main branches of AI. If it weren't, then we wouldn't see as much growth. Machine learning is a subset and doesn't require a large amount of data to train a model. Machine Learning uses statistical models whereas AI has more fuzzy logic modeling, but ML has seen the most success in recent years [statistical models are perfect for today's problems]. Machine Learning doesn't require as much programming knowledge or data science tools to build complex models and algorithms. Even non-programmers can use whatever free tools are available (like Google's AutoML). Machine learning is still in its infancy in comparison with AI and will take another few years or even decades before it becomes as advanced as AI. Now let's look into the second part of the question if Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning has seen significant growth in recent years. Why? Machine learning is one of the two branches of AI and is growing at a rate much faster than the overall industry. Machine Learning is perfect for today's problems as it makes use of statistical data to make accurate predictions. Machine Learning doesn't require as much programming knowledge or data science tools to build complex models and algorithms (mostly because it isn't that difficult).

Though they are not quite the same, the misconception is that they can occasionally cause some confusion. I thus decided that it would be worthwhile to write an essay to clarify the distinction. Let’s look at their key differences in a little more detail: Artificial intelligence Through the use of artificial intelligence, a machine can mimic human behavior. AI aims to create intelligent computer systems that can tackle challenging issues like people. In AI, we create intelligent machines that can carry out any work just like a human. AI has a very broad variety of applications. The goal of AI is to develop an intelligent system that can handle a variety of challenging jobs. The aim of AI systems is to increase their odds of success. Weak AI, General AI, and Strong AI are the three categories into which AI can be separated based on capabilities. It entails learning, thinking, and self-improving. Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data are all handled completely by AI. Machine learning A subset of artificial intelligence called \"machine learning\" enables a system to automatically learn from prior data without explicit programming. Allowing machines to learn from data in order to provide accurate output is the aim of machine learning (ML). In machine learning, we train computers using data to carry out specific tasks and produce correct results. A significant division of machine learning is deep learning. The scope of machine learning is constrained. The goal of machine learning is to develop tools that can only carry out the precise tasks for which they have been specifically programmed. Accuracy and patterns are the fundamental concerns of machine learning. Online recommender systems, Google search algorithms, Facebook auto friend tagging suggestions, etc. are some of the key applications of machine learning. The three main categories of machine learning are reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning. It incorporates education and self-correction when presented with fresh information. Data that is structured and semi-structured is dealt with via machine learning. In short, these both are good careers with tremendous opportunities . There are numerous courses available today. I’ll mention a few popular courses for reference.

In the rapidly changing technological environment, machine learning is playing a vital role in delivering accurate results and predicting the future. In brief, machine learning is defined as the specific approach to artificial intelligence. AI is the most successful approach whereas machine learning is a part of AI that will help you to solve any problem that rises. In the modern day, you might hear a lot of self-driving cars, which are operated through Artificial intelligence and Machine learning. However, if you study that in-depth, you will most likely find AI applications are used through Machine learning. Is machine learning a part of artificial intelligence? While AI and machine learning are closely related, they are not the same thing. Machine learning is regarded as a subset of artificial intelligence. You can study the main differences between artificial intelligence and machine learning through self-study, however, keeping the importance of practical applications in mind, it is recommended to pursue a full-time course in AI and ML Program. Some of the reliable institutes that will teach you about data science and AI program within a year: Learnbay - This institute offers live interactive classes to the students as well as one-to-one doubt-clearing sessions.

We are now recognizing that most things called \"AI\" in the past are nothing more than advanced programming tricks. As long as the programmer is the one supplying all the intelligence to the system by programming it in as a World Model, the system is not really an Artificial Intelligence. It's \"just a program\". Don't model the World; Model the Mind. When you Model the Mind you can create systems capable of Learning everything about the world. It is a much smaller task, since the world is very large and changes behind your back, which means World Models will become obsolete the moment they are made. The only hope to create intelligent systems is to have the system itself create and maintain its own World Models. Continuously, in response to sensory input. Following this line of reasoning, Machine Learning is NOT a subset of AI. It really is the ONLY kind of AI there is. And this is now proving to be true, and in a big way. Since 2012, a specific Machine Learning technique called Deep Learning is taking the AI world by storm. Researchers are abandoning the classical \"Programming Tricks\" style of AI in droves and switching to Deep Learning... based mainly on the fact that it actually works. We've made more progress in three years since 2012 than we've done in the preceeding 25 years on several key AI problems, including Image Understanding (a really hard one), Signal Processing, Voice Understanding, and Text Understanding. Another clue that we are now on the right track: Old style AI projects like CYC ran to millions of propositions or millions of lines of code. Systems that (successfully) Model the Mind can be as small as 600 lines of code; several recent Deep Learning projects clock in somewhere in that range. And these programs can move from one problem domain to another with very few changes to the core; this means these methods are GENERAL intelligences, not specific to any one problem domain. This is why it is called Artificial General Intelligence. And we've never had any AI programs that could do this in the past. As an example, the language understanding programs we are creating using DL will work equally well in any language, not just English. It just takes a re-training to switch to Japanese... another indication that Deep Learning is closer to true intelligence than traditional NLP systems. Google is currently using Machine Learning a lot - in my estimate, over a hundred places in their systems have been replaced by Deep Learning and other ML techniques in the past few years. even their patented \"PageRank\" algorithm which was the initial key to their success is being replaced, even as I write this, with a new algorithm called \"RankBrain\" which is based on Deep Learning. In the shareholder's call last week, the CEO of Google said that they were looking at using ML (probably Deep Learning) *everywhere* in all their products. More generally, I expect a deluge of apps and systems that understand languages and images in the next several years, all based on Deep Learning. I really shouldn't confuse things but strictly speaking, Deep Learning is not AI either. We are currently using Supervised Deep Learning, which is another (but less critical) programmer's cheat since the \"supervision\" is a kind of World Model. Real AI requires Unsupervised Deep Learning. Many people including myself are working on this; it is possibly thousands of times more difficult than Supervised Learning. But this is where we have to go. Deep Learning isn't AI but it's the only thing we have that's on the path to True AI."}
