In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

Some basics that you should also learn while learning Python, using pip, to install libraries. It's very easy to use. For advice, if you understand the dependencies much better, you can just manually install stuff for ML instead of using Anaconda. How to make, manage, activate, and deactivate virtual environments. How to make your Python code readable. If you are using Pycharm, you will be forced to use the PEP8 standards, and do make sure to learn it. It's a brilliant way to make your Python code clean, precise, and easy to read. Don't use VSCODE. How to use import modules, classes, and functions intelligently. How to work with GUIs(use Kivy). These come in handy when you want to show some sort of application in the best way possible, and also make the GUI fast and good-looking. Pycharm has custom support for the KV Design language in kivy. KivyMD also offers you to make M3-designed Android-like UIs for both desktop and Mobile. All using just Python. Using Jupyter Notebooks. This is a key thing to use ML and DL, along with a great set of techniques to visualize Models and data that is going to go inside the system. Jupyter notebooks are really very popular. Almost all kinds of code samples, guides, and tutorials from Tensorflow have a Google Collab runnable ipynb book that you can directly run from the website. Have seen a handful of PyTorch research papers(and failed to understand anything), thanks to the terrible writing with no docs or comments. How should your ML Python code look to others? Like this Comment for every line, if needed. For ML, you can either use sklearn for quick models/Algorithms or Tensorflow/PyTorch for learning how to make ML/Deep Learning models from scratch. I recommend TensorFlow since Oreilly has almost all kinds of guides for TensorFlow whether you want to become an ML engineer or DL engineer or use ML inside the browser. For every type of application, there is a brilliant, amazing, step-by-step guide to use. And that is what is important for just any beginner."}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.
