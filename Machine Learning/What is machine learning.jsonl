Going back to school days, there used to be maths questions in algebra that everyone must have solved. For example: What should be added to a given number to obtain the desired the number. Mathematically, 2 + ____ = 4. If you remember we used to assume the blank as a variable x, that would solve such a problem. Going up later into the Higher classes, we used to generalize the above equation using variables, y & x. To say that if something is added to x , then it will result into y. Establishing a relationship between independent variables x & y. For Example: y = x +2. In Mathematics, we call such an equation as a function : y = f(x). Then we also learn that a function y = f(x), can also be represented graphically. For example: Graph of y = x +2. Moving further above in Applied Mathematics, there is a method of Regression in Statistics. Where we used to find the best fit curve, for a set of data points in a graph. Regression is basically the reverse engineering of what we used to do in school. In school, we were asked to create graph with a given function. and we used either algebraic methods or hit & trial to obtain the data points. In Regression, we do reverse we are given a set of data points already plotted in a graph and we need to find a best fit curve, that passes through all the given data points. Now you must be thinking how is thing related to Machine learning… For that we must understand difference between Traditional Programming & AI(Artificial Intelligence) Programming. Traditional Programming: In this type of programming we provide well defined instructions/rules which the machine such as computer has to follow and then it provides us the desired outcome. Thus we input: data + instruction/rules , and get desired result as output . Here the code is static and system performs only based on the instructions it has been provided. The detailed the instructions such as IF-ELSE cases have to be provided by user such as a developer/programmer. AI Programming : In AI Programming, the approach is a bit different, here we input: data + result , and output is a function that connect data and result. i.e machine has to identify the rule/function which caused the result from given data. Amazing… Isn’t it? The machine identifies the relationship between data points, and tries to develop a rule/condition which best fits between the data and result, and when technically a machine develops a mathematical function which defines a relationship between independent variables y and x, it is called as Machine learning. Where machine is actually learning by itself how two or more are dependent on each other. Thus there is an ML(Machine Learning) Algorithm, which is basically a data driven algorithm, where the user has to feed input data & result based on which algorithm creates a function. (Machine trying to best understand and learn the given data by adjusting best fit function into it.). ML algorithms uses Regression defined above in order to find best fit curve/ function to better understand and learn from data."}

When Facebook's photo application recognizes you in your friends pictures, that's also machine learning. Whenever you read your email from the inbox, an intelligent spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam mails. Two Major Definitions of Machine Learning Arthur Samuel defined Machine Learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. A very recent articulation by Tom Mitchell , defines Machine Learning as a computer program that is said to learn from Experience E , with respect to some Task T , and some Performance Measure P , if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E. Lets take an example of the online Game of Chess where, every game is a Task T with the playing process as an Experience E. Each game will have a final outcome and that is the Performance Measure P. This performance measure will be the probability factor of winning the next game against some new opponent. Now, because the computer has the patience to play tens of thousands of games all by itself, it can just keep improving on its possibilities of the winning streak. Technical Aspects in Machine Learning : A Brief Look We all know how computers are being used for handling and simplifying a host of activities. We are now trying to make the computer learn every macro & micro levels of the human thought processes that leads to multi-variant decision making abilities . By building truly intelligent machines, we can do just about anything that you or I can do. This is done through learning algorithms called neural networks , which mimic how the human brain works. They comprise of comprehensive algorithms & characteristic applications of artificial intelligence working on expert systems. With every activity performed by it, the Computer is taught to self-learn and auto-upgrade itself with decision making capabilities that are progressive, sharp & accurate. Computers learn to remember & process the past experience - based on archived tasks and resultant performance levels. They then predict the most likely occurrence of activities/results in a specific context or situation. Major Applications of Machine Learning Primary Characteristics of Machine Learning Algorithms Although there are several different characteristics of Machine Learning Algorithms, the most important ones are Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning . In Supervised Learning , the idea is to teach the computer about “how to do something” based on a certain set of available data that looks related and uniform. A simple example for Supervised Learning is the prediction of housing prices, based on the possession of several data sets of sold houses in a specific area. Now, just suppose that you need to find the price of a 1250 sq.ft house in a certain locality, based on available data of previously sold houses. So I draw a graph like this with the data that I already have … In this graph, I have plotted area (in sq.ft) on x-axis and corresponding pricing (in Rs. 10k) on the y-axis. The ‘X’ markings in RED represents sold houses. The GREEN line shows our query regarding the possible pricing of a 1250 sq.ft house. It touches the PINK line graph marked as 1 and also touches the BLUE line graph at a place marked 2 . You can thus see 2 possibilities. The point marked as 1 lies on a straight line (drawn using math functions for linear equations) and is based on average values of the plotted house’s price & area. So the predicted price should be around Rs. 25,00,000. However, the point marked 2 lies on the graph (blue color) that has been drawn using the Regression method (or the continuous value method via quadratic equations) whereby you can see that the price of the house gets to be more accurate (in this case its lesser than the previous prediction), somewhere around Rs. 20,00, 000. This graph is drawn using math functions (from Octave, Matlab, Python etc) by passing an iteration of each of the coordinates or data-set-values (plotted data of the sold houses, here Area & Pricing) into a quadratic function (or a second-order polynomial). The subsequent computational result for each data record is a value that needs to be plotted. However, before plotting it onto the graph, this value is further corrected or optimized using the gradient descent algorithm for least variance from its previous or next values . This is to ensure that the finally plotted graph attains its best streamlined flow with help of these nano tweaks. Note: A line drawn between just 2 subsequent coordinates, could involve hundreds or thousands of computations for determining the best optimized value. In Unsupervised Learning we're going to let the machine “learn by itself” with a given set of data that seems cluttered & unorganized. One of the algorithms used in this self learning process is the Clustering Algorithm. One example where clustering is used is in Google News. When you type in SPORTS, google goes and looks at tens of hundreds of thousands of new stories on the web and it groups or CLUSTERS them into cohesive news stories based on Sports and sorted by the latest date. In unsupervised learning based on the prediction results, there is the least possibility of a feedback. Data Cluster is used in several applications like organizing large Computer Clusters in data center’s where specific computers work together more efficiently. They are used in Social Network Analysis like applications where knowledge about which friends you email the most is used to predict your favored friend’s list. They are used in Market Segmentation where many companies having huge database of customer information data, automatically group their customers into different market segments for efficient selling or marketing activities. The list just goes on and on."}

The approach can be used for tasks such as spam filtering, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). This AI-based method has also been incorporated into other applications including self-driving cars, personal assistants, and online advertising. Machine learning systems adapt through experience over time, meaning that they improve with every additional dose of information or training. The machine's behavior is determined by algorithms that encode its experiences. For instance, the algorithms can be used for predictions about outcomes based on previously observed inputs and outputs. In essence, a machine learning algorithm treats its own experience as data to be analyzed in order to infer answers. Machine Learning: Where does it appear? In the broadest sense, we can talk about machine learning in two major contexts- Generalized AI and Application Specific AI. Generalized AI, or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), is the type of intelligence that aims to produce human-like behavior such as a robot performing a useful service, an information filtering system on the web providing search results just like Google, or a self-driving car driving us to our destination without hitting any pedestrians. Application-Specific AI is aimed at solving one specific problem. In this context, there are two types: Deep Machine Learning: This approach involves training deep neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and then use this learning to solve problems. Supervised Machine Learning: In supervised machine learning, the system is trained on a set of examples that have been manually labeled by humans. The labels are then used to train a predictive model which can be used for classification or regression tasks in applications such as document classification, spam detection, image recognition, etc. Machine Learning: How does it work? Machine learning algorithms typically need two things in order to operate- training data and a function called an objective. Training data consists of an input vector (a sequence), along with its correct output value, according to some objective function. This input includes both constant values and values generated randomly by the machine for testing purposes. The machine then uses the training data in order to try and find an input-output mapping that will produce the correct output every time. For example, consider a binary classifier (this is a classification algorithm that outputs only 0 or 1). It takes in data as an input and tries to predict which category it belongs to by looking at patterns found within the data. For instance, if we have pictures of dogs and cats labeled respectively as \"dog\" and \"cat\", our learning algorithm would be trained on this information so as to distinguish between them properly. We can say that the logic behind this process is: given any picture, predict whether it's of a dog or cat. The question here is how does one get these pictures of dogs and cats in the first place? They are labeled randomly by humans so that the machine can learn how to distinguish between them. Machine Learning: Characteristics Every machine learning algorithm is trained on a set of training data with a specific input-output mapping objective function or cost function. The choice of this function determines the quality of the model (since it measures tradeoffs). Costs functions used in ML algorithms typically aim at minimizing prediction error or maximizing classification accuracy. While many standard cost functions exist, they all differ slightly in their implementations. In terms of fairness towards different types of data points, some common metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and cross-entropy. All of these metrics try to measure how bad it is for an algorithm to classify one data point as belonging to a certain category when it actually belongs to a different category. In other words, they reward the machine's success rate while penalizing its failure rate. The cost function that is used will also vary depending on the type of problem that is being solved. The most famous types are classification problems and regression problems. In classification problems, the type of data is discrete- meaning there can be only one class or answer for every piece of information (examples include spam detection, face recognition, etc.). In regression problems, the type of data is continuous with an infinite number of possible answers- this means that every piece of information can be assigned multiple possible answers (examples include real-time price prediction, medical diagnosis, etc.). Machine Learning: Types of Algorithms To solve a given problem, practitioners must identify an appropriate learning algorithm to use. A general rule of thumb is that for classification problems we should choose algorithms with high accuracy and for regression problems we should choose algorithms that are accurate but more robust since absolute error rate isn't important. Here are some examples: Linear Regression: Linear regression uses the concept of linearity to predict continuous values based on a number of input variables. It minimizes the sum of squared error in order to achieve this. This type of algorithm tends to be fast and scalable for big data sets as it avoids iterating through all possible solutions; however, it is unstable. In a nutshell: Linear regression uses linearity to find an equation for predicting a continuous value based on 2 or more input variables. Logistic Regression: A binary classifier, logistic regression is used when there are only two possible outcomes (0/1). It minimizes the error rate of false positives and false negatives- this means that under no circumstances should we predict something true as false or vice versa. Neural Networks: In ML, neural networks are a tool in classification problems and incorporate concepts from neuroscience such as how human brains function. They're used when the data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value. Neural networks consist of multiple hidden layers of neurons with different activation functions at each layer and a final layer for producing results. They're used to solve problems that are non-linear or otherwise difficult to tackle using other algorithms. Neural Networks: two most common activation functions include sigmoid (also called logistic function) and step. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is known as the \"Northeast\" algorithm in several academic circles; it's widely considered to be the best supervised discriminative learning model available today for classification problems. It's particularly useful when there's only one target label, that data points are linearly separable/contiguous, and that samples from all classes are roughly the same size. However, SVM is also known to be unstable and expensive for most real-world problems. SVMs fall into either the linear or the non-linear category depending on whether their decision boundary corresponds to a hyperplane or not. Tree-based algorithms: Many classification problems can be represented as a tree structure where every internal node represents a test with boolean value and an edge between two nodes indicates that if we take the right path at one node we must go left at the other to get out of it (examples include C4.5, CHAID, etc.). Decision trees are used when data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value; they're designed through recursive binary splitting (splitting at the node with maximum information gain). Tree-based algorithms: C4.5 and CHAID are the two most popular examples of Decision Tree Learning. Boosting: Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that's often used when the data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value (examples include AdaBoost, GBDT, etc.). It basically involves training a number of weak classifiers by using some initial probability distribution and then combining them in order to deliver better results than what each individual classifier would deliver on its own. It was initially developed for tackling problems with imbalanced classes (where one class is present in much larger numbers compared to others)."}

In this sense it is meant to be computer science's answer to induction. This definition is probably too narrow now, as the idea of inferring a function from examples makes the most sense with classification or regression problems and makes less sense with clustering or other problems. Historically, machine learning was something of a reaction within artificial intelligence research. AI focused heavily on logic rather than probability or statistics, and preferred heuristic and search to formal optimization. It was also a fairly open ended research program in which it is relatively hard to judge progress. The popularity of machine learning in academia was probably due to the lack of success and growing skepticism people had of AI research in the late 80s. Machine learning is, in comparison, an extremely well defined area focusing on concrete algorithmic and mathematical problems. Focusing on better defined problems with concrete measures of progress probably helped researchers insulate themselves from the discouragement with AI generally (and lack of funding). In actual practice, I think machine learning is just a combination of mathematical optimization and statistics, both academic disciplines in their own right. Machine learning is currently riding something of a popularity wave. My belief is that this is because machine learning is a part of computer science, and hence its practitioners are highly trained computer programmers. This has allowed applications of machine learning in data intensive areas like voice recognition, search, social network analysis, recommendation algorithms, computer vision, etc. Basically the machine learning people got the cool applications and hence the funding. They also had the freedom to ignore some of the culture baggage of traditional statistics, in no small part due to ignorance of it. The current state of the field is that algorithms exist that can be used to solve a single well-defined problem, often better than humans can (for example creating a classifier to recognize spam). However significant work generally needs to be done to get data into a form that is algorithmically usable. Furthermore, these algorithms do not match people's expectation of human intelligence in that they learn a single thing very precisely, but can't learn more than one thing (the same instance of the classifier that predicts spam, won't also predict the stock market). Hence it is not possible for a program to learn like a human learns, continually acquiring new concepts and ideas and understanding the relationship between them. So we are safe from the machines for a little longer."}

Then I state that the classification problem is to find or estimate P X ∼ D ( Y = 1 ∣ X = x ) P X ∼ D ( Y = 1 ∣ X = x ) , Let us now parse the above paragraph and try to understand what it means. Let us ask some key questions. I have not written Y = ϕ ( X ) Y = ϕ ( X ) for some unknown function ϕ : R n ↦ R ϕ : R n ↦ R but as if ( X , Y ) ( X , Y ) have some joint distribution. What does this mean? We are estimating some conditional probability. What is that conditional probability? Why should we actually need the probability? Isn’t it good enough to know if the probability is greater than 0.5 or less than 0.5 to classify it as either this or that? Alright, how do we estimate that probability? So, we are “estimating” the probability. Can we have large errors in this probability estimate even if we have a large sample (whatever large means)? If yes, what can we do to ensure that such an error is not so large? All these questions can be answered logically in sequence. The questions can be ordered in increasing order of difficulty as 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6. For a naïve user of machine learning, they can be ordered in increasing order of usefulness (to whom? :P ) as 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay, now to the answers. Having selected the X X we choose to represent the “features” or the parameters that we use to make the prediction, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the result is unique for each X X . For example, say I want to look at the floor area and geographical location of a building to classify whether the building can or cannot be sold for over $200,000. Now is the answer unique, given the floor area and geographical location? Probably not. People might decide based on many other factors including, how old the building has been, is the building well furnished, is it a pet-friendly community, is it a kid-friendly community, is there a recession going on that people can’t afford expensive house and a million others which we have not included in the model to keep things simple. So, given only two features, viz. floor area and geographical location, the event of selling the house for over $200,000 is indeed random. So given the features, the best we can hope to do is finding the probability this event occurs. The answer to the above point clarifies the use of conditional probability too. Given the values for just the features we used to model the problem, what is the probability of the event we like to predict. This is simple. Sometimes it is not ideal to just classify things this way or that, based on probabilities being above or below 0.5. For example, if you want to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) by observing few parameters that can be observed in a clinic, I would want my predictor to say “yes” even if the probability is say 0.1. This is because, if somebody indeed has cancer and doesn’t undergo further tests, the harm is far more than somebody who doesn’t have cancer but took more tests. So, a statistician (please don’t call us data scientists! we are statisticians!) shouldn’t make the call on what the threshold should be. An expert in the area of application should be the one who should take that call. Ah. This is the part where a lot of people from the Bay Area spend their time on. A naïve way is expected risk minimization. Let me tell you what this is. P X ∼ D ( Y = 1 ∣ X = x ) P X ∼ D ( Y = 1 ∣ X = x ) can be viewed as a function ψ : R n ↦ [ 0 , 1 ] ψ : R n ↦ [ 0 , 1 ] . We don’t know what this function is. We typically have little idea on whether this function is linear or a polynomial or convex or differentiable or continuous or anything on earth. What we do is, we choose a set of functions H H where each element h ∈ H h ∈ H is from R n ↦ [ 0 , 1 ] R n ↦ [ 0 , 1 ] . Then for a suitably chosen threshold, we see how error prone is this function. When people talk about 1. Linear regression, 2. Logistic regression, 3. Neural Networks, 4. Support vector machines, 5. Deep networks 6. any other method on earth, they are basically talking about different sets of functions H H to learn from. When they say they are “running the algorithm” or “learning from data”, they are basically choosing the best element h ∗ ∈ H h ∗ ∈ H , that fits the function ψ ψ we are interested in estimating. Regularization, cross validation, using the ROC/AUROC etc are other (good) heuristics used to ensure, that we are indeed picking the best function in H H . Ah, now comes an interesting question. Is learning possible? What is learnability? When I said choosing “the best h ∈ H h ∈ H , I didn’t necessarily say what is meant by the best h h . It was probably intuitive, given any X ∈ R n X ∈ R n , I want a function h h , which fits ψ ψ well. But all I am given is a few, finitely many points for X X from R n R n and accompanying Y Y from { 0 , 1 } { 0 , 1 } . There is a good chance that some function ¯ h ∈ H h ¯ ∈ H performs very well in the given sample but performs really bad for some points that are not given in the sample. But they are points that are very likely to be encountered in future. (Remember if ( X , Y ) ( X , Y ) have a joint distribution, X X by itself is a random vector). We want to perform well in points that we are very likely to encounter. We don’t mind if our estimator in our example screws up when asked, “Will a house in the middle of Antarctica, with an area 100 ft by 100 ft sell for over $200,000” because such a question is unlikely to be asked probably. So this is what we define by learnability. Chosen a sufficiently large but finite sample to learn from, can our estimator h ∗ h ∗ have an error less than f a c t o r × ϵ + E r r o r ( s a m p l e ) f a c t o r × ϵ + E r r o r ( s a m p l e ) i.e., any error we had in the given sample too, with a probability greater than 1 − δ 1 − δ ? We can only give probabilities on our estimator. This is because there is a very very small chance that in our sampling, the only point we learned repeatedly was a 10,000 sq.ft house in lower Manhattan sold for over $200,000. Though it is extremely unlikely, it is not impossible. That is why we ask the question above in bold, only in terms of probability. The sad fact is, if we have a bad choice of H H , the answer to the question in bold can be “no.” Also there is one more place where things could go wrong. The error in the sample also can be pretty large. Shit! So when does it work? What is a good choice of H H ? This is the studied in Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory and determines what sort of hypothesis classes, H H are learnable. Also, it says how much data would we want so that the difference between the true error and the error we see in our sample is small enough for our requirements. In short, this says, if our hypothesis class H H is too large, then learning becomes difficult. What does too large mean? For example, if we have finitely many elements in H H , then it is learnable. There are also some hypotheses classes, in fact, most of the interesting ones, have infinitely many elements and are still learnable. So the actual “count” of number of elements in H H is not very helpful. What helps is the so called VC dimension of a hypothesis class. It is the largest sample that the hypothesis class can “shatter.” If you don’t understand that, you can just imagine that as the richness of a hypothesis class. If the VC dimension is finite, then it is learnable. Alright, we made sure that the true error is very close to the sample error. Now, how do we choose the optimal learnable H H , so that the sample is small too? That is another place where expert knowledge helps. The expert in the area of application typically chooses whether to use deepnets or logistic regression or SVM or anything else. Though 5 and 6 are quite theoretical in nature, and a day-to-day person who just wants to apply machine learning algorithms wouldn’t want to know much about them, they are the reasons why machine learning even works. That says, how is machine learning different from shooting in the dark, and hoping to hit the target."}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

Thus, it significantly cuts down delivery time and enhances the Customer Delight. ML from what I believe is a nascent field, but growing rapidly, and finding applications in increasingly diverse areas. Companies in E-commerce, police departments, sports betting companies, etc. are increasingly hiring Machine Learning specialists to devise intelligent algorithms to enhance the predictive prowess of their systems.

It's like teaching computers to learn from examples and patterns in data, so they can do tasks without being told exactly what to do. This helps them improve and do things like predict what you might like or drive cars autonomously. Imagine you want to teach a computer to recognise different fruits, like apples and oranges. Instead of giving it a list of rules, you show it many pictures of apples and oranges. The computer looks for patterns in the pictures—maybe it notices that apples are usually round and red or green, while oranges are round and orange. After seeing lots of examples, the computer learns to tell the difference between apples and oranges on its own . Then, when you show it a new picture of a fruit, it can guess whether it's an apple or an orange based on what it learned from the examples. This is how machine learning works: the computer learns from data and uses that learning to make decisions or predictions. Key Principles of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning: In this foundational concept, models are trained using labelled data, where inputs are paired with correct outputs. This enables the model to learn relationships between inputs and outputs, making accurate predictions on new, unseen data possible. Unsupervised Learning: Unlike supervised learning, this approach involves training models with unlabelled data. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data, leading to insights that might not have been apparent at first glance. Reinforcement Learning: This facet of machine learning revolves around training agents to make sequential decisions based on rewards or penalties received from their environment. Through trial and error, agents refine their decision-making skills by maximising cumulative rewards. Real-World Applications of Machine Learning: Healthcare: Machine learning is transforming healthcare by enabling early disease detection, personalised treatment plans, and optimising clinical workflows. Algorithms analyse medical images, aiding in diagnosis and assisting medical professionals. Predicting disease progression and enhancing healthcare systems' efficiency are also part of its contributions. Finance: In the financial sector, machine learning aids in fraud detection, credit scoring, and investment prediction. By analysing historical data, algorithms identify patterns tied to fraudulent transactions and assess creditworthiness. Additionally, they contribute to predicting stock market trends and making informed investment decisions. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This field of machine learning focuses on enabling computers to understand and generate human language. It has revolutionised communication through applications like language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and voice assistants. Machine learning techniques extract meaningful information from textual data, leading to more accurate language processing. Machine learning technology has transformed multiple industries and has great potential for future development. You should seek the advice of experts or enrol in specialist courses if you need assistance including machine learning in your company businesses or if you want to learn more about the topic. For example, ACTE institute provides thorough machine learning training programs that can provide you with the information and abilities needed to succeed in this industry. Consider machine learning's potential to open up countless opportunities for data analysis, automation, and decision-making."}
