In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document.

It all stems from one word; hype . “WHAT!” scream the millions of deep learning enthusiasts and ML engineers waiting in the wings. Let me explain before pitchforks are raised. There is no doubt Machine Learning is an interesting field to be in. It’s not only intellectually stimulating, its results appear near magic to the general public. Machines beating the world’s best at Go, self driving cars, Snapchats face filters. It’s sexy to be a Machine Learning engineer, to be involved in the very real wave of new technologies. But there comes a point where the public greatly over values a profession. News articles such as the New York Times’ listing salaries of 300 - 500k for AI professionals [1] lead young graduates to believe Machine Learning is the best way to make big money. The problem begins when people start to pursue a career in Machine Learning because it’s the supposed “best career” . Combine this with the fact the field is so vaguely defined, encompassing everything from Data Engineers to statisticians to quantitative analysts with Python and you have a misinformed public and a ballooned valuation. Since the field is so young, there are massive shortages in graduates educated with the relevant skills. As a result, salaries have of course rocketed. However, just a few years behind, the Universities of the world are starting more and more “Data Science” and “Machine Learning” degree programmes. Surely, this is the answer to the job shortage problem? Not quite. Because the field’s value is so distorted universities across the globe are starting sub par programmes which receive buckets of applications from (genuinely interested) students. These programmes make nice money for the university but only make the problem worse. Thousands of graduates now qualified as “Machine Learning experts” are under equipped for the task necessary, further clouding the definition of Machine Learning field. You can bet that in the years to come, when ML has stabilised, so too will the salaries and only those who are truly interested in the field will find their jobs fulfilling. The real message I want to communicate in this answer is not that Machine Learning is overly hyped. My main message is that there is no such thing as “the best career”. There is only “the best career for you ” . The most important thing to remember (just like for any job, however publicly valuable) is to honestly assess whether you have a genuine interest in the subject. Do you love playing with data and ML algorithms? Do you find the underlying math beautiful? Machine Learning is a fascinating field and, if it's right for you, it's rewarding, fulfilling and you can make some decent money doing it. But it's important to isolate the publics opinions from your own. Footnotes [1] Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent"}

The programming paradigm is completely different, the required knowledge to do good work is immense, and little of that knowledge is shared in common with other engineering disciplines. I’ve transitioned between different skill areas several times. I did the following three major engineering switches: Bioinformatics to web development (at 2 years programming experience). This was exciting because this was also my transition from an academic setting to a business setting. The best parts were that the objectives were clear, the feedback loop between programming and results were short. Web development to mobile development (at 4 years programming experience). This was definitely the easiest switch; the programming paradigm is similar, but with a bigger emphasis on frontend. If you’re a good frontend engineer, the switch is pretty seamless, and Swift is much kinder to the developer than HTML and CSS from my experience. Mobile development to machine learning (at 5 years programming experience). The last switch was a completely different ball game. Machine learning is different than most types of programming, because it’s driven by data. Traditionally, engineering projects are a direct output of explicit code. There are decades of strategies on how to write good code, as well as tooling to help make that process easy. The process of engineering is usually something like: There’s a feature I need to build or a bug I need to fix Search the code hierarchy for the problem, look at stack traces, implement the feature by testing locally. Run the code through some build process, run unit and integration tests, and see your working product. In machine learning, things look much different. The product is not just built on the code, but also on data. The field is much newer (well, at least in a business context). And the best practices are only currently emerging. I found the most difficult parts to be: Understanding the mathematics behind ML . You need to know lots. Linear algebra, statistics, nonlinear optimization. You can still do ML if you don’t know the math well, but you will be severely limited. The best practices for ML engineering . For every good way to build a system, there are 10 bad ways. Fortunately, this is changing quickly with the introduction of framework-level ML platforms, such as TensorFlow Extended for example. Which models to use : I was pretty obsessed with deep learning and spent too much time thinking about how I could change a model, and not enough time actually just tinkering with the models I have and attempting to train them. Another few things which tricked me up: I spent too much time trying to build my own models and not use pretrained models. Package managers are to software as transfer learning is to machine learning. You can get tons of progress with using word embeddings in NLP, or using the top layer of activations with a pretrained ImageNet model like ResNet. It can literally reduce the training time 10x. If I were to start again, my recommendations would be: Go through one ML tutorial per day. There are lots of great writers out there, and you won’t understand how to code well unless you read lots of code. Read a chapter of an ML textbook per week. Again, that fundamental understanding of math will help you debug really hard problems. Good luck!"}

The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

And because you are an AI expert (let’s assume), you probably aren’t also an expert in software development. You’ll likely discover to your disappointment that building real software products is a lot harder than building simple prototypes. You may also discover that your plan to surround yourself in great developers who can easily integrate your AI-based ideas is not entirely practical either. You may believe that all this great stuff that you are learning about say recurrent neural networks or convolutional architectures are going to be useful for a long time or something that you’ll be building on for years. To your dismay you’ll find that every two years or so the field will have moved away from that and on to something else that you don’t yet understand. This is the nature of AI these days and says something quite meaningful about the lack of a firm foundation and how it’s really an engineering field not a mathematical field. Pick up any book on AI from the 1990s and you’ll notice that almost everything seems foreign and largely abandoned. Realize that, at that time, all these researchers thought they were on to something really big too and imagined those ideas as core components of useful products. The more deeply you understand how AI algorithms work, the more you will realize how the problem it is solving is really not as hard as you thought it was. Another way of saying that is that you’ll realize that things like image classification are nowhere near as hard as lots of other things people do. And while this is making great progress, it is expanding within a constrained area of intelligence. Most of it is concerned with perception and there is no natural path from perceiving the world to building a complex model of the world. If you’re completely new to the business world you may have to learn the hard lesson that just because we can do something doesn’t mean we should do it. It has to be economically feasible and also worth the risk. There is a reasonable possibility that things like self-driving cars (at least level 5) are possible but too expensive to make it practical any time soon. There are many places where today’s AI can replace a human workflow but will take 6 months for a team of 4 to implement which will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That may not pay off for many years and it could fail. And so someone who makes more money than you but doesn’t understand AI will make a business decision to pass on your great idea. Despite these pessimistic thoughts, I don’t want to discourage anyone from going into this field. If you are young and someone is willing to pay you to work on cool stuff and give you great experience, then why not? Worst case is that you fail to deliver much value but learn some valuable lessons that become useful to you in the future. Eventually, you’ll succeed at something though it may not be what you expected."}

The coaster read: “Who says nothing is impossible? I’ve been doing nothing for years!” Well, I’ve been doing ML for almost 40 years (wrote my first ML program waaay back in 1982 on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 10 mainframe computer using Common LISP, which back then was the Python of AI, and everyone in AI — a small bunch of diehards then — coded in LISP). Getting to your question, I’m reminded of an anecdote from Michael Jordan (no, not the basketball player!), a well known ML professor at nearby U.C. Berkeley, who said the best definition of the ML field was that it is the activity of the peculiar constellation of folks who attend the NeurIPS conference. I suppose in that sense, yes, ML is certainly a “made-up profession”. It has neuroscientists, biologists, statisticians, computer scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, physicists, psychologists etc. It’s a complete hodgepodge, and I love that about ML. It has never been a boring field in the past 40 odd years that I’ve been at it. Whenever you get bored, you can always switch to some other topic. My work over the past decades has ranged from very theoretical math-oriented research, collaborations with biologists, psychologists and planetary geochemists, ruminations on philosophy, and everything in between. I think Geoff Hinton, the “father” of deep learning, made a revealing statement to me in a personal conversation many years ago (I knew him since the mid-1980s, when he taught me neural networks in a class at CMU). He said, and I’m paraphrasing a bit: “I started in physics and failed in that field, did a bit of psychology and dropped out of that field, and finally ended up in a field with no standards!” (deep learning!). It worked great for him! He was the winner of the Turing award, computer science’s equivalent of the Nobel prize! He’s truly deserving of that, of course, having spent his entire career on trying to develop computational neuroscience-inspired models. There’s no scientific unity in ML at all that I can discern, and I should know, have written papers in the field for going on 35 years (first two papers published in IJCAI 1985, and the most recent paper in ICML 2020!). Some people adhere to the view that ML is statistics in high dimensions. Some people view ML as the engineering of neuroscience (e.g. deep learning). Some people view ML as computational psychology (e.g., reinforcement learning). Others view it as building embodied AI agents (e.g., roboticists interested in ML). There’s absolutely no shared sense of a common problem formulation, or theoretical framework. That’s both a great source of strength — it’s a blending of many points of view — but also a fundamental weakness. My wife is a statistician, and we’ve been happily married for just as long as I’ve been writing papers in ML! She calls ML the “gosh and golly” profession. What she means is that the vast majority of ML papers are about some “demo”, which essentially says, wow, we trained this deep neural net, and look what it produced (generating face images, NLP chat bot, Atari game player etc.). Take any statistical journal of repute (e.g. JASA, Biometrika, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society etc.). I guarantee you that you will not find an article that says, look, wow, we trained a deep neural net that plays Atari video games! That’s not what a true scientific field like statistics works. Statistics is the one true data science, because the questions it asked and successfully answered are truly as deep as Newton’s laws. Take the simple question of how to abstract data without losing any information. In statistics, this is formalized as the concept of “sufficient statistics”. A sufficient statistic is a function T(X) of some dataset X that retains all the information in X about a class of models M(\\theta), such that P(M(\\theta) | X, T(X)) = P(M(\\theta) | T(X)). What this says in English is that the distribution of models that explain the dataset X given the sufficient statistic T(X) is conditionally independent of the dataset X. It tells you how to abstract data so you don’t need to store it anymore. There’s a vast amount of theory on sufficient statistics that you learn in graduate courses on statistics. For example, the famous Rao-Blackwell theorem states that any (unbiased) estimator of a model that is conditioned on a sufficient statistic T(X) has variance that is lower than any other estimator, unless that other estimator is itself a function of a sufficient statistic. So, this is how statistics works. You formalize the problem using ideas like sufficient statistics, and then you work out the ramifications of the concepts using very rigorous theory. Virtually all the major ideas in statistics, including design of experiments, randomized trials, sampling etc. has a rigorous body of theory, which has deep measure-theoretic foundations. With a small number of exceptions, virtually none of the modern work in ML that has achieved a lot of popular press has any deep theory behind it (e.g., deep learning, deep RL, deep NLP models, GAN models etc.). Like my wife says, it’s all “gosh and golly”. Years ago, Richard Feynman, the well-known physicist who taught for many years at Caltech, gave a commencement ceremony at that august institution where he tried to explain the reasons physics is a science, but in his view, psychology is not. He called fields like psychology “cargo cult sciences”. Cargo Cult Science Feynman related an experiment done in psychology, one of a very small number in his view, where they tried to understand how rats were able to run a maze and do some task involving finding food. Instead of simply reporting on the results, which is what the vast majority of such experiments usually did, like ML does today, the experimenters tried every single way to fool the rats, and then finally discovered the one condition that made the rats not be able to succeed. When they changed that, the rats failed! To Feynman, this is true science. It’s not a demo, or what the famous AI pioneer John McCarthy, who set up the Stanford AI Lab, called the “Look, ma, no hands!” syndrome. For Feynman, science is the process of trying every which way in which to disprove your theory, to find faults with your approach. Virtually no paper in NeurIPS today says, look, we tried every which way to make our methods fail, and here’s the ways in which our method fails! No, they all say, look how great our technique is, it works so well on all these (carefully assembled and hand-tuned) datasets with these parameters. But, I have great hopes that even with all its faults, the “made-up profession” of ML will finally find its savior, someone who will finally put our field on more solid scientific grounds. To see why, all we need to do is understand how the field of statistics became a true science. Ronald Fisher, the “father” of modern statistics, was hired to work at a provincial agricultural station. Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher | British geneticist and statistician At the agricultural station, Fisher was shown a huge room where they had the early 20th century version of a Kaggle dataset, a massive collection of leather bound volumes of agricultural data that the station had patiently collected on soil samples, fertilizer, crop yields and so on, but had no idea how to extract insights from this massive 90 year dataset. Fisher, to his great credit, not only showed how to get insights from this data, he invented the major techniques, from likelihood analysis to randomized trials, that are the bedrock of almost every modern empirical science today, a hundred years later! Fisher faced great challenges in doing his work, not the least of which was that he had no vast AWS or Azure or Google cloud service, all he had was a hand calculator that he affectionately called “The Millionaire”, because that was the largest number it could store! Doing any calculation with the Millionaire involved a lot of cranking of its ponderous mechanisms. Fisher was also incredibly near sighted, and suffered from very poor vision since childhood (a disability that he later prized, as he said he was forced to conceptualize and work out problems in his mind from a very young age). Fisher wrote a series of now legendary papers that changed the field of statistics, and ushered in modern empirical science, for Fisher’s techniques are used everywhere, from large-scale astronomy, such as the investigation of ripples in the big bang afterglow of residual energy, which earned Berkeley physicist Smoot, the Nobel prize, to the latest vaccines that have been designed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Fisher faced the additional hurdle that the most prestigious journal in the field then was Biometrika, but its editor-in-chief, the rival statistician Pearson, hated Fisher, and personally saw to it that few if any of Fisher’s great papers were published in Biometrika. Fisher was forced to publish his work in then more obscure journals. None of this mattered. Ultimately, Fisher’s insights became the stuff of legend, and the world is a far better place a hundred years later because of Fisher and his laborious hand-calculations with the Millionaire. Each of Fisher’s many early papers had dozens of numerical tables, each one of which involved hundreds of hours of manual hand cranking with the Millionaire. Despite all these handicaps, Fisher succeeded, changing our world for the better. So, in a sense, the science of statistics started with a Kaggle like dataset, and it took a genius like Fisher to show how to turn datasets into a true science. There’s hope for ML yet! We may see a true “ML Fisher” emerge one day, and perhaps he or she would develop their ideas from looking at Kaggle datasets! I can’t think of a better New Year’s wish, as we close out this truly horrible 2020, and look forward to a brighter 2021. Happy new year, everyone! May your dreams be realized in the coming year(s)!"}
