In general, pick one or two (that the candidate is good at) and keep going deeper and deeper, rather than go horizontally through some checklist. It is far more indicative of depth. General mastery : when you really understand something (e.g., you've gone through the cycle of learning-doing-teaching-doing), you can express seemingly complex concepts in simple ways. Or you develop insightful views on things at a broader level and can explain it to others. E.g.,: Discuss your views on the relationship between machine learning and statistics. Talk about how Deep Learning (or XYZ method) fits (or not?) within the field. Isn't it all just curve fitting? Talk about that. How are kernel methods different? Why do we need/want the bias term? Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.) How are neural nets related to Fourier transforms? What are Fourier transforms, for that matter? Etc. ML skills specific : E.g., Pick an algorithm you like and walk me through the math and then the implementation of it, in pseudo-code. OK now let's pick another one, maybe more advanced. Discuss the meaning of the ROC curve, and write pseudo-code to generate the data for such a curve. Discuss how you go about feature engineering (look for both intuition and specific evaluation techniques). Etc. Distributed systems (our needs) : E.g., Discuss MapReduce (or your favorite parallelization abstraction). Why is MapReduce referred to as a \"shared-nothing\" architecture (clearly the nodes have to share something, no?) What are the advantages/disadvantages of \"shared-nothing\"? Pick an algorithm. Write the pseudo-code for its parallel version. What are the trade-offs between closed-form and iterative implementations of an algorithm, in the context of distributed systems? Etc. Other (hands-on experience, past accomplishments, etc.) : Do you have experience with R (or Weka, Scikit-learn, SAS, Spark, etc.)? Tell me what you've done with that. Write some example data pipelines in that environment. Tell me about a time when you ... { worked on a project involving ML ; optimized an algorithm for performance/accuracy/etc. } Estimate the amount of time in your past project spent on each segment of your data mining/machine learning work.

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

I’ve realized that many people, when giving advice on ML interview prep, miss one of the most crucial aspects of the process: that there are actually two “parts” to the interview, representing two different types of questions you might be asked. 1. Questions about your specific knowledge of ML theory . Importantly, these are generally questions that have a particular correct answer that the interviewer is looking for. You might be asked about things like bias and variance, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, Bayes’ Theorem and how to use it, how to avoid overfitting models, and other such questions. Of course, the above is critical. If you don’t understand the core concepts of Machine Learning, it will be tough for you to ever become an outstanding machine learning engineer, and a major company wouldn’t take a risk on hiring you - regardless of how charming your smile is. If you’re interested, here’s a relevant list of practice questions . However, I argue that candidates spend way too much time preparing for the above, and not enough on the second category of ML interview questions: 2. Machine Learning system design questions. These are open-ended questions that don’t have a particular correct answer you can quote. Instead, you will be asked to think about, make decisions, and explain your logic in designing a complex system. Some examples of such questions include: Design a search ranking system for a search engine Design a recommendation system for a Netflix-like platform Design a Twitter-like feed system that shows people the most relevant Tweets to them Design an ad prediction system to show relevant ads to users As you can see, questions like these require you to integrate your knowledge of ML theory with the ability to “zoom out” and think about real-world ML problems at a high level. More so than your specific solutions, interviewers are interested in hearing about how you approach such problems. What factors do you consider? What tradeoffs do you make? Why? Your performance on questions like these makes a huge difference on not just your hire/no hire decision, but also your hiring level, which is often just as important and can make a huge difference on your salary. There aren’t too many resources out there that will help you prepare for ML system design questions. The best one for it is Grokking the Machine Learning Interview , which focuses on the system design aspect of ML in depth."}

I also look to see if they understand high performance computing and not just vanilla coding. I was asked to do this as a consultant, acting as a subject matter expert to help interview junior people for the firm. In our interviews, we asked a candidate to present some code they had written and to talk through it.   For an ML person, it would be some kind of ML code. So, for example, I was involved with an interview with a Physics PhD from MIT discussing some NMF code he wrote in javascript.   The javascript was very good and he would be fine doing GUI work , Node.JS work, etc.  Certainly not something I could do. Can he do Machine Learning.  Mind you, he has a PhD in a math heavy subject from one of the top 10 schools in the world.  So he should know the math. I wanted to see if he knew how to get it to converge properly.  He did not.     He knew it was non-convex, but he did not know how to seed it, nor did he know about the convex variants. He tried to give me some nonsense about it being Bi-convex and whatnot. Dude, just use Kmeans++  to seed it.  Thats it.  Thats all you had to say.   This got totally past the VP of engineering and the CTO.    (They were just impressed that machine learning involved computing a first order derivative--something neither had since since college calculus) So here, he knew some basic methods, but did not really know the most important ideas in the field, the important developments,  how to really code this.  It is clear that he had never done anything like this in his former work, nor did he really understand numerical methods. This means that his solution would never work in production and -- more importantly -- that he would have no idea how to evaluate it or how to  fix it.  I see this a lot.   Also, he did not know the available open source codes, how they worked internally, and  which one to use,  or how to evaluate their performance.  For being a PhD from MIT, this was unacceptable to me. There was also a code evaluation.  For me, one needs to know what runs fast and what does not. What good is a method that only runs on 300 data points?!     In this case, this interviewee had written his own javascript matrix library.  Did he know the BLAS libraries and how they work?  Or an alternative?     This is critical because you can't run anything in production if the code is too slow.   I see the same problem with most ruby coders--they just don't know numerical computing. I was not looking to evaluate 10,000 of complex code , whether he used Agile or Unit Testing.  Nor did I care about solving some high school brain teaser. I just wanted to see a small piece of code, with good engineering choices ,   a good understanding of the math, and how to make this solution work in a modest production environment . Id rather see old fashioned spectral clustering with a  Fortran library, which can scale, as opposed to trying to use a \"fancy\" method like NMF or LDA if you can not get it to work in production at scale.  (I'm not saying they don't scale--I am saying you better know how to get them to scale if you choose to use them) In another interview, again a PhD (Ukrainian I think) who was very bright and had solved some good problems and had experience.  He was using an off-the-shelf SVM tool--a tool I know very well.   I asked a very basic question--how do you adjust the cost parameter for the SVM regularizer.   I rephrased the question a couple of different ways to give him a chance.    FAIL   In other words, did you read the documentation of the tool and did you understand which parameters to tweak and which ones to leave at the default settings  ( I kinda would like the person to have read the entire source code of the tool and know how it works. )   Again, this demonstrates a failure of the most basic mathematical concepts in ML -- Regularization-- and how they would apply in production.  Tuning this parameter can increase accuracy by %10-15 (or more).  Again, just simple stuff--but important stuff  This also shows a lack of attention to notice the important details of the work.  We actually offered this guy the job and he asked for a salary way out of the ballpark.  If he had not missed this critical question he might have been able to make the case for the salary. Having shared all this, I would add that I think , for you, the market is very good and you will probably not encounter anything like this.  Why?  All you need to do is know more machine learning than the VP and the CTO--and here the bar is very low.   Everyone and his brother has a funding to do machine learning and they usually just need to solve one small problem and get the product out the door.  Most  (i.e 7/10 ) CTOs and VPs know absolutely nothing about even basic   machine learning  so they have no clue  even what to  ask. (Newton Raphson will blow them away, and they will think you are too expensive if you try compare stochastic gradient descent to interior point methods)  They got their start up funded based on the market potential of  the idea, and they are expected to hire people to invent their IP. (Obviously if you are interviewing at Google or Lockheed Martin, disregard all of this and hire me once you get in) P.S.   I was asked once by some VP/CTO evaluating me what the volume of a rectangular prism is.  AlI could think of was this old Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon  with the Prism on it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon I would never ask this kind of question but you will probably get asked many   puzzle questions like this if you are fresh out of school (or an old man like me I guess)  I seem to recall there are books and/or web sites with tons of these.

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

For example if it’s an image processing company, read about popular approaches for image detection, identification, segmentation, tracking, clustering, etc. Also, there are a few things which you are expected to know and are shared among almost all use cases. You should have ideas how to approach scenarios like this: How to use labeled and unlabeled data? What if you don’t have any labeled data?

And to be honest these 10 questions are just a drop in the sea. Machine learning is continuously developing and with time, new concepts will emerge hence it will be vital that you harbor a constant urge to learn and upskill. Read Journals, join online communities, and attend ML seminars and conferences. As the process of preparing an interview can be overwhelming, we have decided to help by curating a list of 10 commonly asked questions in ML interviews. Let's get started! Q1 Define Recall and Precision Recall or true positive rate refers to the total number of positive claimed by a model as compared to the actual number of positives which are present throughout the data Precision or positive predictive value precisely predicts the number of true positives claimed by a model compared to the number of positives it actually claims. Q2) Why is Bayes referred to as “Naive Bayes? Naive Bayes is referred to as “naive” because despite having many practical applications it is based on the assumption that it is impossible to find real-life data. All the features in a data set are independent, equal, and crucial. In the naive Bayes approach, conditional probability is computed as a pure product of the probabilities of individual components thus implying the complete independence of features. Sadly, this assumption can never occur in a real-life situation. Q3) What are the two methods for calibration in supervised learning? The two calibration methods are isotonic regression and Platt calibration. Both these methods are designed especially for binary classification. Q4) What is F1 Score? F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance that is an average of the recall of a model and precision which results nearing to 1 being the best and those nearing 0 being the worst. The F1 score can be used in classification tests that do not give priority to true negatives. Q5) What is Ensemble learning? It uses a combination of learning algorithms to optimize the predictive performance of models. In this, the multiple models like classifiers or experts are both strategically generated and combined to prevent Overfitting in models. It is used to enhance the classification, prediction, performance, function approximation etc. of a model. Q6) Difference between machine learning and deep learning? Machine learning involves the application and usage of advanced algorithms to uncover the hidden patterns within the data, parse data, and learn from it, and finally apply those learned insights to make informed business decisions. Meanwhile, Deep learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves the use of Artificial Neural Nets which draw inspiration from the neural net structure of the human brain. Also, deep learning is used in feature detection. Q7) What is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 errors? Type 1 error is a false positive error that ‘claims’ that an incident has occurred when actually nothing has happened. An example of a false positive error is a false fire alarm. The alarm starts ringing even though there’s no fire. Type 2 error is a false negative error that ‘claims’ nothing has occurred when something has surely happened. Type 2 error would be to tell a pregnant lady that she isn’t carrying a baby. Q8) Explain the variance and bias of the term. The error of a learning algorithm during the process of training is decomposed into two parts – bias and variance. Variance denotes an error caused because of the complexity of that learning algorithm in data analyzation while bias is an error situation caused due to the use of simple assumptions in the learning algorithm. Variance is measured by how much the learning algorithm’s prediction varies for different training data sets and bias measures the proximity of the average classifier which is created by the learning algorithm to the target function. Q9) Why do you prune a Decision Tree? They are pruned to get rid of the branches with weak predictive abilities. Pruning can be either done from the top-down or bottom-up. It helps to minimize the complexity quotient of the Decision Tree model and optimize its predictive accuracy. Cost-complexity pruning, minimum error pruning, reduced error pruning, error complexity pruning are some of the used Decision Tree pruning methods. Q10) How would you handle corrupted or missing data in a dataset? You must drop the rows and columns or replace them with other values. Pandas library has two methods to find missing or corrupted data - dropna() and isnull(. These functions help find the rows/columns of data with corrupted data and drop those values."}
{"instruction": "What-are-some-common-machine-learning-interview-questions", "context": "", "responses": "I think that your interviewers will want to see some experience in ML. I guess that this is your first job in this domain so I would suggest working on a small-medium independent open source project which will be \"cool\" and based upon an ML algo'. Something like a facebook app, mobile app, small web site. This will give you that needed edge over other newbies. By doing so, there is a good chance that they will spend some of the interview time by asking you about your project, which you will know well, instead of asking you more and more \"tricky\" questions..Good luck!"}

So I can perhaps add some input there. Coding, Data Structures and Algorithms: First and foremost, as a machine learning engineer, you’d be expected to have basic SDE qualifications. This includes knowledge of general data structures and algorithms. You’d typically be asked in this area during a live coding session. For the coding question itself, LeetCode is full of many examples of common coding questions. Like joining multiple arrays, traversing of linked lists, or whatnot. While solving such questions, you should expect questions of the likes: What data structure is suitable for this type of problem? Why? Breadth or Depth first? Can you think of a different way to solve it (here usually is an indication that you used an inefficient algorithm) What is the complexity of this method? (Big O Notation) Database Typically using SQL. Just like the coding questions, you’d typically get a SQL question that requires you join tables, do some groupings, filtering, and whatnot. I haven’t seen anything too crazy with the SQL questions. Machine Learning Breadth: In contrasts to Scientists, engineers are less likely to be examined in the depth of their knowledge in a particular ML domain. They are rather expected to have a breadth of knowledge across the ML domains. Such questions are usually (and should be) tailored to your resume. Examples of such questions (again will depend on your resume): Why did you apply model X? Why not model Z? What other models are you aware of? How did you handle missing data, multicollinearity, curse of dimensionalities, etc. etc. Can you explain in simple terms the difference between logistic regression and SVM? Infrastructure & Maintenance: The value of ML engineers over ML or Applied Scientists (also sometimes data scientists), is that ML engineers are expected to spend more time in the production side of things, as opposed to spending time in researching and prototyping the solution methodology. Hence, you’re expected to have a decent knowledge of how to deploy, scale, and maintain models in production. Ideally using cloud platforms. The sort of questions here: How did you deploy models in productions? What did you use for CI/CD and version control? How do you make sure your model is running as intended? (MLOps) Which cloud platform did you use (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)? Company culture & principles: Those are the questions I mostly worry about because they can get tricky. Though for engineers, they’re likely to be less impactful than for analysts or scientists. These questions usually start with “tell me about a time when” or “what would you do if”. Examples: Tell me about a time when you disagreed with your manager? What would you do if your team mate was frequently delaying your projects by submitting incomplete work? Overall, the above were definitely few of the questions that I came across. Of course they don’t cover everything that I have came across or haven’t. But this should give you a general idea of what to expect. As you are answering such questions, your interviewer will typically be assessing your communication style, ability to articulate, clarity, and overall professionalism. The culture and principles assessment spans across all other questions as well, whether Data structure, SQL, or ML questions. Now I do not know who is asking this question. But if you are a fresh graduate, you’d likely be wondering how can you answer a question of the sort “how did you deploy models in production before”. That can be the case indeed. ML Engineers are not expected to be entry level applicants. You also asked about data analysts and data engineers in your question. But it is not fair to equate those 3 roles as having relevant questions. Actually, data engineering can be like a pre-med, where ML engineering is med. You’d be expected to have some practical (i.e. industry) software engineering experience (or at least practical data science experience) in order to apply and prepare for ML Engineering jobs."}
