In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

If you want to experiment with real-time industrial projects as a novice and you are searching for the right training curriculum, I would recommend Learnbay' s best educational facility for courses in machine learning and projects in the real world industry .Learnbay Offer 12+ real world industry projects and 2 capstone projects under the mentor-ship and guidance of Data Science and AI Experts. I share the list of some ideas for a Machine Learning project that will improve your foundation and enable you to ascend the ladder in the area of machine learning. Media and Entertainment(Netflix Movies and TV Shows): -Understand what the content is Enabled in different countries To recognize related material through Text-based matching capabilities Network identification of performers / executives Then come up with insightful observations. Retail(Walmart Sales Forecasting): -This dataset contains the sales for each department from the Walmart dataset containing data of 45 Walmart stores, selected holiday markdown events are also included . These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact. Healthcare(Analyzing Health Data and tracking human activity):- The goal is to breakdown all the data that the Health app has collected and see what useful insights we can gain by analyzing it. Banking & Finance(Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.) Demand/Supply(Forecasting Uber Demand ) Banking & Finance(Loan Default Prediction) Happy Learning!!"}

Typically, there are the following categories of projects: Comparing existing techniques on some data : Start with a machine learning problem, for which you have data, and the approach to which is not immediately obvious. An example is the Diabetic Retinopathy problem from Kaggle. Then, try a bunch of ML techniques (different algorithms like SVM, logistic regression, etc. if it is a classification problem), dimensionality reduction techniques, other preprocessing techniques, etc. to get an insight of the problem and the techniques. You can look at current or past Kaggle competitions for problems. Feature extraction : Here, you have an ill-defined problem to start with, like face-recognition. You need to model it somehow, so that you can generate “good features”. Good features would be similar for faces of the same person and very different for faces of different people. So the goal here is to generate good features, that can be supplied to some standard ML algorithm like SVM to get good accuracy. Implementation : Identify some papers that introduce interesting techniques, and implement them. Optimization : Identify some problem that takes a while to run, and try to find ways to make it faster without compromising much on the accuracy. You can also try very different optimization methods on this problem to see how they perform, e.g., use genetic algorithm instead of simulated annealing. New algorithm : Identify a problem, like classification, clustering etc. and propose an algorithm that intuitively should do the “right thing”. See how well it does compared to other standard algorithms. Theory : Prove some theoretical results on some existing algorithm or a new algorithm. You can obviously combine several of these techniques to build a larger project. Once you have some vague ideas in mind, brainstorm with others — your group members (if any), classmates, seniors, professors — to formalize these further. Getting the data and arranging computation resources (memory + CPU time) are often challenging. So make sure you consider those aspects while brainstorming."}
