{"instruction": "what is machine learning?", "context": "", "responses": "In order to understand Machine Learning, There is a need to understand the concept of Functions in Mathematics. Going back to school days, there used to be maths questions in algebra that everyone must have solved. For example: What should be added to a given number to obtain the desired the number. Mathematically, 2 + ____ = 4. If you remember we used to assume the blank as a variable x, that would solve such a problem. Going up later into the Higher classes, we used to generalize the above equation using variables, y & x. To say that if something is added to x , then it will result into y. Establ … (more)"}

{"instruction": "what is machine learning?", "context": "", "responses": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence, where the computer \"learns\" about something without being explicitly programmed. The approach can be used for tasks such as spam filtering, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). This AI-based method has also been incorporated into other applications including self-driving cars, personal assistants, and online advertising. Machine learning systems adapt through experience over time, meaning that they improve with every additional dose of information or training. The machine's behavior is determined by algorithms that encode … (more)"}
{"instruction": "what is machine learning?", "context": "", "responses": "The classical definition is that it is the study of algorithms that infer the function they compute from example data. An example of this is the \"Theory of the Learnable\" paper which is arguably the seminal machine learning publication (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1972). In this sense it is meant to be computer science's answer to induction. This definition is probably too narrow now, as the idea of inferring a function from examples makes the most sense with classification or regression problems and makes less sense with clustering or other problems. Historically, machine learning was … (more)"}

Essentially, it involves developing algorithms and models that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly told what to do or how to do it. In machine learning, computers are fed large amounts of data, and they use statistical algorithms to identify patterns in the data. These patterns can then be used to make predictions or decisions about new data that the machine has not seen before. There are several … (more)"}

Let me give an introduction on what supervised classification is all about. Let X , Y X , Y be a random variables (vectors), where X X is in R n R n and Y Y is in { 0 , 1 } { 0 , 1 } . Let us assume ( X , Y ) ( X , Y ) have some joint distribution D D which is unknown. Then I state that the classification problem is to find or estimate P X ∼ D ( Y = 1 ∣ X = x ) P X ∼ D ( Y = 1 ∣ X = x ) , Let us now parse the above paragraph and try to understand what it means.

At it’s core, it’s an algorithm or model that learns patterns in big data and then predicts similar patterns in new data. In layman’s terms, it’s the theory that machines should be able to learn and adapt through experience to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. While ML isn’t new, theres now more data than ever which has attributed to it’s recent popularity.

Did you wonder how the recommendations seem to always be about such items that you have been wanting to buy? That is one example of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) (from my rudimentary understanding, the terms are interchangeable.) ML essentially means a machine which has the capacity to learn. So depending on your past searches, the Amazon or Facebook website code will have learnt what sort of items you are looking for.

{"instruction": "what is machine learning?", "context": "", "responses": "Machine learning is when computers learn from data and make decisions on their own without explicit instructions. It's like teaching computers to learn from examples and patterns in data, so they can do tasks without being told exactly what to do. This helps them improve and do things like predict what you might like or drive cars autonomously. Imagine you want to teach a computer to recognise different fruits, like apples and oranges. Instead of giving it a list of rules, you show it many pictures of apples and oranges. The computer looks for patterns in the pictures—maybe it notices that appl … (more)"}
