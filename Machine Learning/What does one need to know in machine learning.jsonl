Machine learning means learning from data ; AI is a buzzword. Machine learning lives up to the hype: there are an incredible number of problems that you can solve by providing the right training data to the right learning algorithms. Call it AI if that helps you sell it, but know that AI, at least as used outside of academia, is often a buzzword that can mean whatever people want it to mean. Machine learning is about data and algorithms, but mostly data. There’s a lot of excitement about advances in machine learning algorithms, and particularly about deep learning . But data is the key ingredient that makes machine learning possible. You can have machine learning without sophisticated algorithms, but not without good data. Unless you have a lot of data, you should stick to simple models. Machine learning trains a model from patterns in your data, exploring a space of possible models defined by parameters. If your parameter space is too big, you’ll overfit to your training data and train a model that doesn’t generalize beyond it. A detailed explanation requires more math , but as a rule you should keep your models as simple as possible. Machine learning can only be as good as the data you use to train it. The phrase “ garbage in, garbage out ” predates machine learning, but it aptly characterizes a key limitation of machine learning. Machine learning can only discover patterns that are present in your training data. For supervised machine learning tasks like classification , you’ll need a robust collection of correctly labeled, richly featured training data. Machine learning only works if your training data is representative. Just as a fund prospectus warns that “past performance is no guarantee of future results”, machine learning should warn that it’s only guaranteed to work for data generated by the same distribution that generated its training data. Be vigilant of skews between training data and production data, and retrain your models frequently so they don’t become stale. Most of the hard work for machine learning is data transformation. From reading the hype about new machine learning techniques, you might think that machine learning is mostly about selecting and tuning algorithms. The reality is more prosaic: most of your time and effort goes into data cleansing and feature engineering — that is, transforming raw features into features that better represent the signal in your data. Deep learning is a revolutionary advance, but it isn’t a magic bullet. Deep learning has earned its hype by delivering advances across a broad range of machine learning application areas. Moreover, deep learning automates some of the work traditionally performed through feature engineering, especially for image and video data. But deep learning isn’t a silver bullet. You can’t just use it out of the box, and you’ll still need to invest significant effort in data cleansing and transformation. Machine learning systems are highly vulnerable to operator error. With apologies to the NRA, “Machine learning algorithms don’t kill people; people kill people.” When machine learning systems fail, it’s rarely because of problems with the machine learning algorithm. More likely, you’ve introduced human error into the training data, creating bias or some other systematic error. Always be skeptical, and approach machine learning with the discipline you apply to software engineering. Machine learning can inadvertently create a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many applications of machine learning, the decisions you make today affect the training data you collect tomorrow. Once your machine learning system embeds biases into its model, it can continue generating new training data that reinforces those biases. And some biases can ruin people’s lives. Be responsible: don’t create self-fulfilling prophecies. AI is not going to become self-aware, rise up, and destroy humanity. A surprising number of people ( cough ) seem to be getting their ideas about artificial intelligence from science fiction movies. We should be inspired by science fiction, but not so credulous that we mistake it for reality. There are enough real and present dangers to worry about, from consciously evil human beings to unconsciously biased machine learning models. So you can stop worrying about SkyNet and “ superintelligence ”. There’s far more to machine learning than I can explain in a top-10 list. But hopefully this serves as a useful introduction for non-experts."}

The people who do ML are a curious amalgam of computer scientists, neuroscientists, statisticians, biologists, philosophers, physicists, engineers, and thinkers of various sorts. Just attend a NIPS meeting, and you’ll see why. If anything, this defines the field. As Michael Jordan (U.C.

A method of combining features such that a decision can be made. Usually this is some variant of a weighted sum, but not always. An approach for learning the optimal way to combine features . Typically, this is accomplished with math, by minimizing the prediction error on the set of examples. Often times, solving for the exact solution is not feasible, so approximations are used. In a way, machine learning is very similar to how you and I make decisions. Suppose for a moment: You decide between multiple job offers. How do you make that decision? You would compare the offers according to some set of criteria (features): Compensation Type of work Perks Title Company Brand and so forth How would you weigh some features over others? Is compensation more important than perks? On a personal level, we each weigh these features differently. However, should we examine how job changes are made at a population level, it becomes clear which features are weighted more heavily than others, and to what extent. Machine learning, then, is the quantification of decision making that may otherwise be intuition for you or me."}

If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

Machine learning is a broad learning platform to learn many skills and has vast knowledge about the subject. What is machine learning? Machine learning is a sub-area of artificial intelligence. It is also an important component of the growing field of data science. It works on data just like humans do. Machine learning means finding new data and content without telling them where to look with the help of algorithms. Some common examples of machine learning models are: 1. Image recognition(it includes facial recognition as in mobile phones, X-ray machines, etc) 2. Speech recognition(it includes the translation of voice into text) 3. Medical diagnosis(diagnosis of various diseases through machines) 4. Statistical arbitrage(analyse large data sets to improve the results of an organization) 5. Productive analysis(predict customers' behaviours and increase productivity) How to learn machine learning? Machine learning can be learned in many ways. One of the convenient ways to learn it is online mode as it will save you time and you can learn according to your indulgence. If you are already working and you want to learn machine learning by side so you can learn it on the weekends through an online course.

Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence discipline, there have been efforts to solve problems using algorithms for which it was necessary to program the solution. Unlike these approaches, machine learning does not require programming the solution but is based on programs that learn by themselves. The models that underpin machine learning emerged in the 1940s but is until now, thanks to the capabilities of computers and the vast amount of data available, that they are showing their potential, whether it's recognizing friends on Facebook, recommending Netflix movies, identifying cancer on x-rays, helping lawyers, driving cars, talking to customers or recognizing voices, to name a few.

ML gained significant traction these recent years thanks to the advances of deep learning [2] techniques. These in fact have been improving lately thanks to the explosion of available computational resources and data and to new engineering techniques (most notably GPU usage). All this improvement had great impact on real-world problems: image recognition and translation are some of the few applications that have improved beyond imagination. Alas, (some of) the media made the subject a sensational topic and is currently actively exploiting the mass’s fear of “killing AI”. That was the general introduction. Let’s get into more details: Despite the recent fad, ML isn’t a recent field. One can trace back its origins to pattern recognition [3] and computational learning theory [4] . Instead, as stated in the introduction, what is recent is the success that it is having (mostly thanks to the rise of humongous data collections and the availablity of cheap compute). In the past, ML experienced “winter” [5] periods where funding was scarce. Hopefully, no more winters to come. ML is a computer science discipline that consists in making computers “learn” from data rather than programming instructions. For example, imagine you had to implement a gender (male vs female) recognition software. If you had to implement this in the traditional way, you would need to extract features that would help you decide. Then, you would write a lot of code to instruct the computer how to use these features. Unfortunately, this approach is tedious and not robust enough. On the other hand, the ML approach consists in collecting lots of images and labeling them. Then, running an ML algorithm that will learn the task by observing the data. By the way, this approach is called supervised learning. ML algorithms come in various flavors. One of the most used form is supervised learning [6] as discussed in the example above. It consists in providing the computer with data about the thing to learn (this is called features ) and also the correct thing to learn (this is called a target ). In the previous example, a feature would be the height of the person (for traditional algorithms) or the edges in the image (for a deep learning model). The target would be the gender. In contrast, in unsupervised learning [7] the target isn’t provided and the algorithm has to rely on other representations to learn. In the supervised learning world, there is further distinction between classification [8] and regression [9] . The above recognition example is a classification problem since it consists in classifying discrete instances (male or female). A regression problem would be learning how apartment prices (a continuous target) vary according to location. Deep learning is a sub-field of ML . It is dubbed “deep” because it uses (artificial) neural network [10] structures with many layers. ML is an evolving and exciting field. Many jobs exist and many more will. It is the modern form of literacy [11] in our technological and data-driven society. Learn about it as much as you can. Finally, current versions of ML models won’t kill you since they aren’t sentient [12] and the road to making them this way is uncertain and distant. However, ML used within weapons and trained to do so could. This is why it is crucial to make as many people as possible informed about ML, what it is (and isn’t) really, and how to use it for great things (while avoiding unethical applications). I hope this helps.
