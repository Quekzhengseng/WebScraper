In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

Superrich: Companies that do machine learning AND have their own data. Servicers: Companies that do machine learning on other people’s data. Innovators: Companies that do machine learning and have to get access to data. All three of these type of companies can be massively successful and each one has a distinct flavor. The Superrich are companies like Google, Facebook, Baidu, Tencent, Amazon, Microsoft, and others. There are very few of these companies in the world but they have a massive advantage over everyone else in the machine learning space because they have access to vast amounts of clean, structured data. Engineers that do machine learning can do what they do best … predict the future. The Servicers help other firms make use of large amounts of data. These companies comb through data (sometimes unstructured) and develop insights. These companies are essentially service firms because they work directly with the data of their customers. One of the most successful Servicers is Palantir Technologies which made a name of itself helping government organizations make sense of the data. Salesforce.com also is creating initiatives to do this. Many other companies fit into this mold (for instance, a company that helps airlines optimize its pricing). And any consultancy fits in this category too. The Innovators — are companies that are working on a specific problem but don’t have access to their own data and are not service-oriented companies that help others. These are companies that want to use data to cure cancer, creating self-driving car technology, and predicting the stock market (like hedge funds). Some of these firms, like Two Sigma Investments and Point72 Asset Management , spend hundreds of millions of dollars on data because unlike the Superrich, they do not generate tons of data themselves. Other good example of Innovators are Cruise Automation (self-driving cars and recently acquired by GM) and Flatiron Health (cancer research). Flatiron Health felt it had to acquire a software services company, Altos Solutions, to get access to raw data. Of course, once these Innovators get the data, they still need to stand it up, clean it, merge it, join it, and do a bunch of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) . Summation: As access to data becomes more democratized, we will see more and more Innovators starting and being successful. Today, the Superrich have a big advantage but we should see more Innovators that are focused on a specific solution winning in the future."}
