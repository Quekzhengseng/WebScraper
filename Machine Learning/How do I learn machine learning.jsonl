So start by polishing up your maths skills. ML currently is a very hot area with many more people trying to learn it but most don't understand that the underlying principles in machine learning are that of optimization theory in maths. Thus to give you a boost revisit the prerequisites. Maths : Linear algebra: Make sure you are comfortable with matrices, vectors and singular value decomposition (SVD). Calculus: Especially differential calculus, become comfortable with evaluation of derivatives of any function and learn chain rule. Numerical optimization: Like I said above ML is currently more related to numerical optimization than anything else. Most optimization methods are variants of gradient descent such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). So learn about first order and second order optimization methods. Statistics and probability: Bayes theorem, random variables, probability distribution functions such as the Binomial and Gaussian distributions. Sigmoid and softmax functions are motivated by probability. Programming : In any of the following: Python: Is an easy to learn scripted language that you can quickly pick up for the purpose of practicing what you are learning. Python has a lot of ML libraries supporting it thus it is ideal not only for beginners but also for experts. Java: is a fairly high-level language that is fairly easy to learn but not as easy as Python. It also has a lot of ML libraries supporting it. C/C++: Don't mess with this one at beginner level but start getting used to writing ML code from scratch as you advance so that you can learn more details about most ML algorithms. It is recommended to build your own mini-ML library at some point in your learning journey using such low-level high-performance languages. With that said, there are several roadmaps to reaching your destination. I can split them up into three stages. Beginner stage. Intermediary stage. Advanced (expert) stage. Beginner stage : The beginning part has been partially covered above, begin with maths. And if you are not good at maths you will need to make sure you are good. Thus make sure to sharpen the axe before starting to chop down the tree. Maths is very important for learning ML as most of the times, systems are expressed in mathematical terms. So before starting, please go through the basics. Don't worry about forgetting something along the way, you can always go back to revisit the stuff you have forgotten, this is not an exam. This is where you also have to set yourself up for success in ML, so I suggest you skim through the basic concepts of ML and the book [1] by Ian Goodfellow and others is an excellent book to introduce you to ML and the current hot area in ML called deep learning (DL). Go through the book in any order you like but make sure to read the introduction first. At beginner level is also the time to sharpen up another axe, programming. Practice coding on problems that are not even related to ML so that you can learn the syntax of that language. You can't learn coding by reading but through practice. Python being English-like is very easy to pick up and there are a lot of resources out there teaching Python coding. Just Google and you will find high quality tutorials on Python programming. In fact your best way to learn coding is to just jump directly to coding and just Google and Stackoverflow your way through learning the syntax of the language. Every modern programmer owes their project completions to Google and Stackoverflow, let no one lie to you, we are in an era of powerful “cheating” tools like Google search. Don't just copy and paste though, understand the solutions you find online and code your own versions afterwards. If you can't code a matrix operation in Python just Google and try to understand what others did. Sometimes very basic code can be just copied and pasted. Also go through the TensorFlow (TF) tutorials as well. They will not only introduce you to TF but also to the concepts of ML such as linear and logistic regression. Intermediary stage : At this stage you should have already read several online sources such as articles, books and watched several YouTube videos on ML and you should have coded up some models at high-level using libraries like TF. Now it is time to start moving forward, you need to make sure that that knowledge does not slip away, you need to consolidate that knowledge in your mind. This is where things start to get interesting because you need to now ask yourself, can I implement backpropagation algorithm from scratch? You will notice that you probably wouldn't, that's okay. You need at this point to start pursuing proofs like deriving mathematical expressions you find while reading ML literature. Try to derive backprop for simple neural networks yourself from your own perspective and understanding and see if you can translate that maths to actual working code. Try to also implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) from scratch. This is where you start to build your mini-ML library. You will be able to learn a great deal of detail about ML this way. Implement stochastic gradient descent and train your own ML models using your own mini-ML library and debug until the models work comparable to those from mature libraries like TF. Open source the mini-ML library afterwards to further show off your skills to potential employers or for the purpose of getting into the Google Brain residency program for example. You also need to start reading journal after journal at this point. At first it will be hard but with more reading and rereading you will start to understand even complex journals from the likes of DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft, Facebook and Google. If you start to understand journals it means you are advancing well towards your goal. Advanced stage : Yes coding your own mini-ML library is sort of like reinventing the wheel but it is essential for learning the details of the most important underlying concepts in machine learning but not sufficient to make you an expert. This advanced stage comes after spending a few years in the intermediary stage. In the advanced stage you need to start paying attention to your own intuitions and ideas. Build or start working on actual novel ML algorithms. You will need to empirically or theoretically validate your ideas by implementing them and doing lots of experiments. It is somewhat hard to design a novel ML algorithm as the ideas come, in form of a eureka moment, after years or months of thinking and lots of research work. This is why being at an advanced level requires that you have built up a strong mental model of the field of ML from a variety of angles. You don't have to be an expert programmer though, as the coding skills only need to help you implement your models. At this stage start asking and pursuing deep questions to which there are no answers yet. Focus on areas that are counterintuitive and try to come up with more novel intuitive solutions to those areas. It is like a PhD program. That is a possible roadmap for someone trying to learn ML. It is also important to practice by explaining complex ML systems to someone else. Quora is a great place for answering ML related questions, that way you will be able to consolidate your knowledge when explaining the ML algorithms to others, it's a win-win situation, you help others while you gain and consolidate knowledge yourself. The other thing worth noting is that you really need to be passionate about the ML field otherwise it won’t be easy. You also need to have tenacity because some concepts take long to understand fully, you may think that you get a concept up until it's time to implement it yourself. Thus learning ML especially by yourself requires serious discipline and focus. You can only maintain that focus if you are passionate and determined to learn ML. With that said the journey itself is quite fun, fulfilling and challenging, not hard but challenging just keep going and read anything that interests you concerning ML. Be passionately curious, you will get there. Hope this helps. Footnotes [1] Deep Learning"}

There are several alternatives available to you if you want to get the necessary abilities and begin a career in the field of Machine Learning. There are several colleges on the market that provide Machine Learning courses from where you can simply launch your career. I would suggest Learnbay Institute and Simplilearn Institute among the plethora of institutes since they give the greatest training program and employment help program. The following are the five most essential subjects in machine learning that you should be familiar with: Probability It aids in forecasting the likelihood of occurrences as well as determining if a scenario mayor cannot occur again. The cornerstone of machine learning is said to be a probability. 2. Calculus The topic of calculus is significant in the realm of mathematics, and it is used in a variety of ML methods. Data sets with numerous characteristics are utilized to develop ML models since multiple multivariable calculus is necessary for creating an ML model. Differentiation and integration are two of the most crucial calculus subjects to master. 3. Linear Algebra It is concerned with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is one of the most significant requirements for studying ML since it can be used to modify and operate on datasets. 4. Statistics It comprises tools that are used to extract results from data. Descriptive statistics are a type of statistics that aid in the transformation of raw data into useful information. Another type of statistics is inferential statistics, which is used to extract essential information from a sample of data using a whole dataset. 5. Programming If we really want to implement the entire Machine Learning process, we must know at least one computer language, such as R or Python. Both of the aforementioned programming languages include built-in libraries that make it relatively simple to construct Machine Learning algorithms. If you want to begin studying the aforementioned machine learning principles, there are a few things you need to do: Recognizing the Prerequisites: Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Statistics, and Python are all prerequisites. You don't need a Ph.D. in these areas to get started, but you do need a basic understanding. Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus are both required for Machine Learning. Statistics is a field of mathematics concerned with data collection, analysis, and presentation. As a result, it is unsurprising that you will need to study it. Furthermore, there is one thing you must not overlook: Python. Instructor-led instruction: If you want to switch jobs in machine learning and have both long-term and quick professional advancement, you can learn machine learning through instructor-led courses. Understanding Various ML Concepts: Model, Feature, Target (Label), Training, and Prediction are some of the core ideas in ML. Machine learning may be classified into four types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. You must also investigate several theories and conduct experiments on real-world datasets. This will help you build intuition about which kind of models are appropriate in certain circumstances. Along with these processes, it is critical to understand how to analyze the data obtained by using various models. This is easier to do if you're familiar with the various tuning settings and regularisation methods used on different models. Categorization : It aids in the prediction of discrete variables or a class of data. It involves determining if a person has an illness, whether an email is a spam, whether a transaction is valid or fraudulent, and so forth. Take part in projects: After you've mastered the foundations of Machine Learning, you may go on to the interesting and entertaining portion. PROJECTS! These will effectively improve your ML skills by combining your most theoretical understanding with the actual application.

Then, I realized that I had to strengthen my skills in math (espacially Linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability Theory), in order to delve deeper into ML theory, so I considered reading books such as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop and Machine Learning by Tom Mitchel along with watching some MOOCs in math. For example, Gilbert Strang’s lectures on Linear Algebra never get old and can be accessed on YouTube, Single Variable Calculus and Multi-Variate Calculus also on YouTube and Harvard’s Statistics 110 . Then I started to familiarize myself with some key languages which I thought would suffice for my future ML application developing such as Python, Java, R and Matlab. Although I had reviewed them during my BSc studies, I thought that revising them was a nice opportunity to refresh my skills and maybe check other problems that I had skipped previously. I would especially recommend implementing a solution to a classification problem in Python using the scikit-learn library at this point (maybe something in text mining), in order to get a first touch with ML engineering. Finally, I became interested in Neural Networks and Deep Learning. However, due to the fact that modules of this kind weren’t a part of our BSc curriculum I figured out that the best solution was to check Geoffrey Hinton’s MOOC on Coursera conserning Neural Networks in order to get a nice grasp from maybe one of the top experts in the field. Later on, I went through reading and implementing the code in Nielsen’s Deep Learning and Neural Networks online book , which was life-changing for me as it is so nicely written, compact and easy to understand. In addition to that, I delved into Deep Learning library tutorials (e.g. Theano , Lasagne and Caffe ), in order to give myself some flexibility concerning which library I could use depending on the problem. I would also like to add that a nice overview of Deep Learning is given in this book of the same name by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, which also covers the math fundamentals needed to understand how Deep Learning works.

Create a project from the template, write code with assistance, build, flash, run/debug, and even view the peripherals – all without leaving the IDE. CLion’s editor is super smart. Features like automated refactorings, completion hints, and code generation are great time-savers. All editor actions are context-aware, so you only get the relevant suggestions. CLion monitors code as you type, making it easy to spot errors on the fly. For dynamic analysis, there’s integration with the performance profiler, code coverage tool, and Valgrind analyzer to help you catch runtime errors. The debugger is equipped with all the necessities like stepping actions, variables and threads, hex view, and more. But CLion also adds a lot of its own advantages. You can view memory and disassembly, attach to processes, and debug core dumps and CMake scripts. If you need to dig into assembly without running your code, you can do that, too. When it comes to testing, CLion provides full integration with Boost, Google Test, Catch, and Doctest. Writing tests is quick and easy, and CLion’s test runner helps you run, debug, and analyze them. CLion also comes with JetBrains AI Assistant, which will help you with anything you need – from understanding errors to polishing your commit messages. Finally, the CLion team always responds to feature requests, bug reports, and support messages. In summary, CLion is a comprehensive but not overly complex tool created by experts, and it continues to evolve and become more and more refined."}

Machine learning is a great field to get into; not only is it highly sought after by employers, it also helps you understand the world in a new way. Most machine learning algorithms are based heavily in math, and are made possible by programming. Here are the basic things I would suggest picking up as you tackle machine learning: Matrix Algebra: Matrix algebra is really important when you start working with large amounts of data; here’s a good online matrix algebra class from MIT: Linear Algebra Statistics : It’s been argued that machine learning is really just computer aided statistics. I’m not sure if I totally agree with that, but having a basis in statistics will help you wrap your head around a lot of the simpler learning algorithms (i.e. regression). I haven’t taken this course specifically, but I’ve heard good things about Udacity’s statistics offering: Elementary Statistics Course Online Calculus : I know, now it sounds like I’m just listing off every math class I know—like I said, machine learning is math-heavy. You don’t need that much calculus, but having a basic grasp of what a derivative is will be really helpful. This page is pretty simple, but if you can get through it and fell like you understand what’s going on, you’re in good shape (at least to start): The Definition of the Derivative Programming : Of course you’ll have to program in order to actually implement learning algorithms, and it’s good to know a general purpose programming language. You said you have experience with Java and Python and those are great. If you didn’t I would recommend picking up Python through CodeCademy: Python MatLab : It’s important to know how to program in general, but it’s also really helpful to be familiar with MatLab; you can effectively study machine learning in another language (i.e. Python) but so many of the resources for beginners use MatLab. If you are in college you can probably get MatLab for free through your institution. If not, I would suggest trying out Octave; it’s fairly similar to MatLab, and its free. Basic Learning Algorithms : Finally to the fun stuff. To get a feel for the basics I would strongly suggest you check out Andrew Ng’s Coursera course on machine learning. It’s well made, and very accessible. In it he draws on all the things in this list; although he briefly introduces each of these subjects, it’ll be a lot easier if you have a foundation in all of them before tackling machine learning: Machine Learning - Stanford University | Coursera If you can make your way through this list, by the end you should at least be familiar with the field of machine learning, and be prepared to figure out what you want to learn next. Good luck!"}

The basic mathematical skills required are Linear Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Probability and some basic Calculus. Linear Algebra The best source to study Linear Algebra is Prof. Gilbert Strang’s Linear Algebra book/course . Video Lectures | Linear Algebra | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW). There are 34 lectures and believe me, they are completely worth it as after completing this, linear algebra should not pose any more problems for you. Solve some exercises/exams if you want to achieve mastery (recommended). Matrix Algebra Matrix algebra is an essential component of deep learning. I personally recommend this ( Matrix Cookbook by Kaare Brandt Petersen & Michael Syskind Pedersen ): http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf (PDF). There are 66 pages of pure matrix operations and this is the absolute “go-to” in case you are stuck trying to understand certain matrix manipulations that a researcher might have done. Probability & Statistics Understanding probability is a very important aspect of understanding ML. Some of the key probability concepts that you must be aware of include Bayes’ Theorem, distributions, MLE, regression, inference and so on. The best resource for this is Think Stats (Exploratory Data Analysis in Python) by Allen Downey : http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf (PDF). This absolute gem of a book is 264 pages long and covers all the aspects of probability and statistics that you need to understand with relevant Python code. Optimization The go-to book for Convex Optimization is Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe : https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf (PDF). This is a 730 page book and you need not read it all in one go. Choose the concept which you need to learn depending on your requirements and interest and read that part. It is complete and extremely well written. This book is free as part of the CVX 101 MOOC on EdX. This 263 page book on metaheuristics, Essentials of Metaheuristics by Sean Luke ( http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf (PDF)) talks about gradient based optimization, policy optimization etc. and it is well written. One can choose to go through this also if interested. Data science concepts are covered in the above topics. Other topics can be learnt by googling for sources easily as and when you encounter them. But complete understanding of the above should suffice for 95% of all scenarios. Achieving mastery of the above topics will surely make you a mathematically strong AI/ML engineer. Now that you have built the foundation, start dipping your feet into research papers . They are absolutely essential as these clearly show the standards of AI researchers/engineers. Firstly, find out the famous papers of AI like RNN, LSTM, SVM etc. and go through the technical content. Can you understand the jargon? Can you understand the mathematics? Can you implement the mathematics in code now without the help of overly sufficient libraries? These are the key questions to be answered. Once you can answer “Yes/Mostly Yes” to these 3 questions, you are good to go. After trying to read these papers dealing with the most popular concepts, try to read the not-so-famous papers. arXiv is a great site with hundreds of preprints being published everyday by top researchers and reading the papers from here is like drinking straight out of the fire-hose. Try to choose a paper which looks fairly well written and the abstract seems interesting. Then, read that paper and try to answer those 3 questions again. The same can be done with papers of top AI conferences like NIPS, AAAI, AAMAS, IJCAI, ICML etc. You may not be able to fully implement the papers due to data constraints and other issues, but if you are able to understand even 60% of the mathematical reasoning, then I can safely say you have completed your training . Do not concentrate on learning more and more “packages” . Concentrate on the concept. While implementing, you will automatically see that you require “this” package and then you will automatically learn to use it. Learning the various commands of random packages won’t help. If you start implementing and writing codes to solve problems or simulate results from a paper, you will automatically learn about packages and use them appropriately; they’ll be the least of your concerns. This is the correct way to maintain “balance” between math and coding. You can also participate in competitions (e.g. Kaggle or conference competitions) to improve speed, development and processing skills if you feel the need to do so.

You can link to a book and some youtube videos and forums, if you're just experimenting and you're studying for your passion and interest. But if you want to start your machine learning career , you have to learn in a realistic and structured way. I am having around 5 years of experience in IT industry and was working in ETL and data warehousing , I wanted to start my career in data science and machine learning and for that i need to learn all the modules and as well as work on real time projects as well. This was very difficult to do without the expert mentorship and an organised course so, i have enrolled for an IBM certified AI and ML Program provide by Learnbay which is designed for professionals. Since i was attending live online sessions so , it helped me a lot. You can also do machine learning courses by Coursera refer some blogs. Hope the above steps help you."}

Why do I draw the distinction? Well, there are lots of folks in the market that are great engineers and there are also lots of folks who are great at machine learning, but there is a severe shortage of great Machine Learning Engineers. Engineers who are great in both fields are basically unicorns and are at least 10x as valuable as someone who is great in just one of the fields. These are the engineers who don’t just work on algorithms or systems all day but instead launch personalization products in the market. These are the types of engineers who are behind the personalization teams at companies such as Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn and many successful personalization startups So, what do you do if you want to become one of these unicorns? (In no particular order) 1. Learn how to be a great engineer .  Learn multiple languages and get really good at them. Don’t just focus on a single language such as Python as many Machine Learning Engineers do. Instead, broaden your scope to include languages like Java, C++, Scala and JavaScript. This will allow you to join a team and and to hit the ground running with any company's systems you work with. 2. Learn how to build highly-scaled distributed systems .  Build systems that have a 50ms SLA and take hundreds or thousands of transactions per second. Ideally, systems that are critical for a business to run. Real-time event ingestion and recommendations systems are ideal. 3. Build your machine learning fundamentals by studying some material on the subject: Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning lectures are a great start: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599 Stanford’s Data Mining and Applications Certificate: http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=1209602 Machine Learning Summer School: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZSO_6-bSqHQCIYxE3ycGLXHMjK3XV7Iz 4. Play with some big datasets that are publicly available . Find a dataset that you find personally interesting or that you have theories about and see if you are correct! US Government Data http://www.data.gov/ SF City Data http://datasf.org/ (I personally find local data easy to identify with) Reddit/r/DataSets https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets 5. Take a role with a product-focused machine learning or personalization team .  The team you search for should be filled with engineers whom you think you can both teach and learn from. This will make you a much better machine-learning engineer. Also, by working on a product team you will quickly learn how the science and theory of machine learning differ from the practice. In particular, how customer behavior will teach you something new every single day."}

Here is a roadmap that I’d follow myself if I were to start again in Machine Learning: Learn Python : I think Python is by far the best programming language when it comes to Machine Learning. I will spend significant time learning Python basics - variables, constants, loops, lists, dictionary, functions, etc. There are some excellent online courses on Python programming. Pick up one such course and complete it end-to-end. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms : Directly jumping from Python Programming to Machine Learning will absolutely be overwhelming. Machine Learning requires extensive programming skills and it is extremely important to be able to do that, otherwise one would find things frustrating. Imagine, you know the basics of writing a Python program, and there is a Machine Learning problem in front of you, which you can easily solve, but you can’t write code for - how frustrating would that be? Therefore, I’d highly recommend spending time studying Data Structures and Algorithms. In any case, if you are going to apply for a job in Machine Learning, you are sure to face a Data Structures round and so, why not prepare for it? CLRS is the best book for Data Structures and algorithms. There are some great courses in Data Structures and Algorithms. I find the Coursera course to be quite relevant. However, if you are looking for a Python-specific course, then try this one . I’d not recommend spending money on purchasing certifications for Data Structures courses. Your focus should be on studying the course material and learning from it rather than a certification. Learn Machine Learning : Now that you know how to write code, and handle some relatively sizeable programs, it is the right time to jump into Machine Learning. The best course to begin with is the Coursera Machine Learning Course . This is a completely free course and is taught by Andrew Ng - a leading Machine Learning Scientist. I’d suggest that one should complete this course end-to-end including the assignments and exercises. The course will help you learn the basics of Machine Learning and you’d be ready to solve ML problems. Once you’re through with this course, its the time to apply your knowledge to create meaningful projects which you can showcase on your resume. There is an excellent course for this that I’d highly recommend - Learn Machine Learning By Building Projects . You would not only learn the concepts of ML in this course, but also you’d be creating some excellent projects which will help you on your resume shortlisting for job interviews. If done sincerely, the entire above curriculum can be completed in a time period of 2 - 3 months in the best case, and 3 - 4 months in an average case. I think one should aim for 15 - 20 days for Learning the basics of Python, another 15 - 20 days for Data Structures, and the remaining time on Learning actual Machine Learning curriculum. Apart from this, here are some general thoughts: To avoid boredom, you may want to consider partnering with a friend so that you both can learn together and most importantly, discuss doubts and collaborate. You both can bounce off problem statements at each other and challenge each other - the whole learning experience would become far more engaging. While Machine Learning would be a lot of theory, I’d highly recommend keeping the focus on implementation of the algorithms. Nothing gives more clarity than implementing the algorithm and writing a working code. Only reading theory isn’t going to help. If you are not able to understand any specific algorithm, search it on YouTube and you would find some amazing videos and alternative explanations which will help you clear the doubt. To participate in Machine Learning contests, you may want to enroll yourself on Kaggle . It is the most popular site for Machine Learning datasets and contests. The roadmap that I have explained above is only to get yourself started in Machine Learning and grab and entry level job. By no means it is exhaustive. The sky is the limit when it comes to learning ML. Happy learning!"}
