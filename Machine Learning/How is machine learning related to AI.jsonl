So when I introduce machine learning in articles targeted at a wide audience I describe it as \"the principal technology underpinning the recent advances in artificial intelligence\". Artificial intelligence as a field actually includes a lot more than machine learning, it's just that recently a lot challenges that were considered very hard have been solved using ideas from machine learning. Machine learning is actually used for many applications that might not be thought of as artificial intelligence. Machine learning is also one of the principal technologies underpinning *data science*. And to the extent that AI underpins data science I think it does so *through* machine learning. So there are two broad components to what machine learning does: AI and data science. Data science itself also involves a lot more than just machine learning, as does AI. Machine learning is a data driven approach to decision making, and it therefore overlaps a great deal with statistics. In the past, when asked to distinguish between statistics and machine learning I put it roughly as follows: \"Statistics is trying to turn humans into computers, while machine learning is trying to turn computers into humans. Neither task is currently possible so we meet somewhere in the middle.\" What I mean by that is the following: the main aim of the field of statistics (at its inception) was to ensure that we weren't misled by statistics. Statistics are just summary numbers and the field was called mathematical statistics. People were interested in proving things about particular statistics you could compute that would allow you to be confident in your conclusions about the world given the data (are people in London richer or poorer than people in Manchester?). Humans have natural inductive biases which cause us to see patterns where there are none. A major preoccupation of statistics is ensuring that a particular statistic is not just exploiting this tendency. In my quote the computer represents an idealised decision maker that wouldn't have such a bias, and statisticians work towards trying to ensure that important decisions are made without such biases. Machine learning researchers, on the other hand, are fascinated by all the things that humans can do that computers can't. Many of these things are actually the positive side effects of our inductive biases (our tendency to see patterns). So we would actually like to have methods that encode these biases. So the philosophy of statistics and machine learning (certainly at outset) is quite different and that leads to different emphasis. Note in all these discussions there's no one field that's right and one field that's wrong. We're just interested in slightly different things. It's very important to bear that in mind when involved in interdisciplinary discussion, otherwise frustration and argument results! From a personal perspective I love the fact that data driven research is a pass to 'access all areas', so the interface between statistics and machine learning really excites me. And it's fantastic that machine learning has been so influential that we are asked to contribute to debates in both data science and artificial intelligence. I hope we do so constructively!"}
