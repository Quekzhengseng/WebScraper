With that in mind, several companies discovered soon enough that fighting for protection was becoming an ever increasing ($$) exercise. The biggest security/infrastructure firms (symantec, mcafee, palo alto, checkpoint etc) united  to work in common initiatives, such as developing web apps against DoD attacks (web apps not in the sense of website but in firewall webapps, also called next generation firewalls). Now, a very important concept here to remember: They do not exchange their solutions, they do exchange their attacks. That's a very important point. This is called SecIntel Exchange. The whole idea behind this is: To understand how attacks are done and what types of exploits are there, we need to increase our catch network, so they can be aware of attacks BEFORE they become a real worry. OK, now that these companies found a common protocol to receive and analyze their attacks, and are able to collect information about what's going on out there in the wild, each company go about and find solutions appropriate for their own products. This is a great strategy, defend as a stronghold, attack as a militia. However, another challenge comes up: Slowly but surely this process is also becoming time-consuming and expensive. In short, it does not scale. Remember, while a company has a team of 10 people to protect, the world always will have thousands working 24x7 trying to break it. (that also explains why Linux/Unix systems don't have as many vulnerabilities as Windows for example, but that's another topic) Good. Now that's when machine learning (ML) comes in nicely!  In conjunction with other technologies (virtual machines, test simulators, honey pots etc) machine learning algorithms can pick up the information collected by the SecIntel and QUICKLY SCALE the analysis process. What used to take 2 days for an InfoSec team to understand, takes 1 day for an ML algorithm to understand...but that's not the main benefit of ML. The main benefit is that the ML algorithms will learn and predict based on experience and results. It means that today it takes 1 day, tomorrow it will take 20 hours, the next day it will take 12 hours and so on. ML by \"learning and predicting\" effectively scale the effort to a level human teams cannot do, specially when dealing with automated tasks. Imagine when you do blood tests if your blood had to be analysed individually. It would take weeks before you get your results not because the process is slow but mainly because the queue to get to you will be too large and by then the effort to get the results could be potentially wasted. By scaling the effort, ML will free up the InfoSec teams to focus in the higher ground and strategy trying to be one step ahead of the game. It is about scale and quick response to market."}

Let’s see how. Machine Learning: Before talking about machine learning lets talk about another concept that is called data mining. Data mining is a technique of examining a large pre-existing database and extracting new information from that database, it’s easy to understand, right, machine learning does the same, in fact, machine learning is a type of data mining technique. Here’s is a basic definition of machine learning – “ Machine Learning is a technique of parsing data, learn from that data and then apply what they have learned to make an informed decision ” Now a days many of big companies use machine learning to give there users a better experience, some of the examples are, Amazon using machine learning to give better product choice recommendations to there costumers based on their preferences, Netflix uses machine learning to give better suggestions to their users of the Tv series or movie or shows that they would like to watch. Deep Learning: Deep learning is actually a subset of machine learning. It technically is machine learning and functions in the same way but it has different capabilities. The main difference between deep and machine learning is, machine learning models become better progressively but the model still needs some guidance. If a machine learning model returns an inaccurate prediction then the programmer needs to fix that problem explicitly but in the case of deep learning, the model does it by himself. Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning. Let’s take an example to understand both machine learning and deep learning – Suppose we have a flashlight and we teach a machine learning model that whenever someone says “dark” the flashlight should be on, now the machine learning model will analyze different phrases said by people and it will search for the word “dark” and as the word comes the flashlight will be on but what if someone said “I am not able to see anything the light is very dim”, where the user wants the flashlight to be on but the sentence does not the consist the word “dark” so the flashlight will not be on. That’s where deep learning is different from machine learning. If it were a deep learning model it would on the flashlight, a deep learning model is able to learn from its own method of computing. Deep learning provides a more advanced form of threat protection, than AI or machine learning solutions available in the market. And to stay ahead of the latest threats, a deep learning solution becomes a necessity. Deep learning is changing the way we look at threats and by that fact – cybersecurity. Which is exactly why it is being used by numerous deep learning cybersecurity companies . Artificial intelligence: Now if we talk about AI, it is completely a different thing from Machine learning and deep learning, actually deep learning and machine learning both are the subsets of AI. There is no fixed definition for AI, you will find a different definition everywhere, but here is a definition that will give you an idea of what exactly AI is. “ AI is a ability of computer program to function like a human brain ” AI means to actually replicate a human brain, the way a human brain thinks, works and functions. The truth is we are not able to establish a proper AI till now but we are very close to establishing it, one of the examples of AI is Sophia , the most advanced AI model present today. The reason we are not able to establish proper AI till now is, we don’t know the many aspects of the human brain till now like why do we dream? etc."}

The article by “Eliezer Kanal - Technical Manager - Cyber Security Foundations” The year 2016 witnessed advancements in artificial intelligence in self-driving cars, language translation, and big data. That same time period, however, also witnessed the rise of ransomware, botnets, and attack vectors as popular forms of malware attack , with cybercriminals continually expanding their methods of attack (e.g., attached scripts to phishing emails and randomization ), according to Malware Byte's State of Malware report . To complement the skills and capacities of human analysts, organizations are turning to machine learning (ML) in hopes of providing a more forceful deterrent. ABI Research forecasts that \"machine learning in cybersecurity will boost big data, intelligence, and analytics spending to $96 billion by 2021.\" At the SEI, machine learning has played a critical role across several technologies and practices that we have developed to reduce the opportunity for and limit the damage of cyber attacks. In this post--the first in a series highlighting the application of machine learning across several research projects--I introduce the concept of machine learning, explain how machine learning is applied in practice, and touch on its application to cybersecurity throughout the article. Machine learning refers to systems that are able to automatically improve with experience. Traditionally, no matter how many times you use software to perform the same exact task, the software won't get any smarter. Always launch your browser and visit the same exact website? A traditional browser won't \"learn\" that it should probably just bring you there by itself when first launched. With ML, software can gain the ability to learn from previous observations to make inferences about both future behavior, as well as guess what you want to do in new scenarios. From thermostats that optimize heating to your daily schedule, autonomous vehicles that customize your ride to your location, and advertising agencies seeking to keep ads relevant to individual users, ML has found a niche in all aspects of our daily life. To understand how ML works we first need to understand the fuel that makes ML possible: data. Consider an email spam detection algorithm. Original spam filters would simply blacklist certain addresses and allow other mail through. ML enhanced this considerably by comparing verified spam emails with verified legitimate email and seeing which \"features\" were present more frequently in one or the other. For example, intentionally misspelled words (\"V!AGR4\"), the presence of hyperlinks to known malicious websites, and virus-laden attachments are likely features indicative of spam rather than legitimate email. (More discussion on \"features\" below.) This process of automatically inferring a label (i.e., \"spam\" vs \"legitimate\") is called classification , and is one of the major applications of ML techniques. It is worth mentioning that one other very common technique is forecasting , the use of historical data to predict future behavior. While considerable research and technology has been developed to perform forecasting, the remainder of this post will focus on classification. There are two major types of ML classification techniques: supervised learning and unsupervised learning , which are differentiated by the data (i.e., input) that they accept. Supervised learning refers to algorithms that are provided with a set of labeled training data, with the task of learning what differentiates the labels. While in our previous example there were only two labels--\"spam\" and \"legitimate\"--other scenarios may contain many, many more. For example, modern image recognition algorithms, such as Google Image search , can accurately distinguish tens of thousands of objects, and modern facial recognition algorithms exceed the performance of human beings . By learning what makes each category unique, the algorithm can then be presented with new, unlabeled data and apply a correct label. Note the criticality in choosing a representative training dataset; if the training data contains only dogs and cats, but the new photo is a fish, the algorithm will have no way of knowing the proper label. Unsupervised learning refers to algorithms provided with unlabeled training data, with the task of inferring the categories all by itself. Sometimes labeled data is very rare, or the task of labeling is itself very hard, or we may not even know if labels exist. For example, consider the case of network flow data. While we have enormous amounts of data to examine, attempting to label data would be extremely time-intensive, and it would be very hard for a human to determine what label to assign. Given how good machines are at finding patterns in large datasets, it is often much easier to simply have the machine separate data into groups for us. Note that separating data into groups assumes that the relevant data is present. Determining the color of someone's skin is fairly trivial for a sighted person, but a blind person will find that task much harder since they are lacking the most important sensor. They will have to rely on other information, such as the person's voice, to correctly \"label\" the individual. Machines are no different in this regard. We mentioned earlier the concept of a feature . This concept can be understood fairly straightforwardly: if our data is stored in a spreadsheet where a single row represents one data point, then the features are the columns. For our email example, some features may be the sender, recipient, date, and content of the email. From our network flow example, features include packet size, remote IP address, network port, packet content, or any of the hundreds of different attributes that network traffic can have. Having useful features is a critical prerequisite for being able to successfully apply machine learning techniques. Simultaneously, having too many non-informative features may degrade algorithm performance, as the overabundance of noise can hide more useful information. To that extent, there is an entire branch within machine learning referred to as feature engineering . The goal of this practice is to extract the maximum information from the available features so as to maximize our ability to predict or categorize unknown data. Frequently these techniques will take multiple features and combine or transform them in complex ways to obtain new, more informative features. While a full treatment of these approaches is outside the scope of this article, interested readers are encouraged to read up on Principle Component Analysis (PCA), a fairly straightforward yet highly useful technique for both creating new data from existing features, as well reducing the number of total features required for the algorithm to function. One last topic to address is that of big data . From the above cases we can understand that more data is almost always a good thing; it allows algorithms to be aware of many more varieties of categories. Continuing our email example, while one person may get a lot of spam, many people get a tremendous amount of spam, providing that many more examples for the ML algorithm to train against. Within the past ten years, as the value of data has been realized, enormous databases for all types of imaginable data have sprung up containing sometimes billions of rows of data, with hundreds of thousands of features. Such enormous datasets are technically hard to work with, and an entire field of research and tooling has developed with the specific intent of simplifying the process of working with data of this size. This is the field of big data. The steps required to create a ML tool are varied, but typically proceed as follows: Data collection . While it's possible to run and even create ML algorithms based on streaming, real-time data (e.g., trading decision based on stock market data), the majority of techniques involve collecting data ahead of time and creating a model using stored data. Data cleaning . Raw data is often unusable for ML purposes. There may be missing data, inconsistent data use (e.g., a cardinality feature may contain \"North\", \"north\", and \"N\", all identical in meaning), and numeric data with non-numeric characters, among many other possible problems. This step also involves combining multiple data sources to a single usable source. Cleaning is often a time-consuming and iterative process, as fixing one issue often uncovers another. Feature engineering . After all the data is ready for use it's time to ensure that maximum information is extracted from the data itself, as described above. This process usually takes place prior to creating the ML algorithm. Model building/model validation . This set of steps involves building the model and testing to ensure it works properly on unlabeled data. There are many statistical considerations to consider when testing the model. When working with supervised ML, a chief concern is whether the model is overfit to the training data, i.e., whether the model that was produced takes into account properties that are unique to the training data. There are many statistical techniques used to minimize this risk, which are often employed during model validation. Deployment/Monitoring . Deployment of an ML model is rarely a \"once-and-done\" event. Generally, and especially in the case of network traffic, historical observations does not necessarily match future activity. For that reason, even after deployment, models are monitored and periodically rerun through the build/validate step to ensure top performance.

If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again.

A general purpose computer has a lot of behaviors - it will transmit and receive lots of kinds of traffic with a variety of servers, often seeming random. It’s difficult to predict and generally difficult to categorize what it’s doing. Now consider a simple IoT device - a wifi light switch. This is much more straightforward. It likely talks to two sets of web servers - one for upgrades, one for remote control. Unless it’s receiving a software update, it likely never sends or receives very much data from these servers. If it gets compromised, however, that behavior will change. Suddenly it may start transmitting or receiving a lot of data. It may start talking to different servers. Or if it’s used on an infrastructure attack (like the Mirai botnet was), it might start transmitting lots of DNS (Domain Name Service, used to translate domain names to numeric addresses) to try to DDOS parts of the Internet infrastructure. Normally it has simple behaviors. It’s when it breaks with those behaviors that it becomes dangerous. We’ve used firewalls to protect devices from threats. Mostly they protect our own devices from the Internet at large, but they can also protect the Internet from our devices. Our firewalls are really dumb, though. They’re usually hand configured to filter out certain IP addresses and certain services. Web servers are also sometimes protected by application level firewalls - these would inspect all requests going to the server and block suspicious ones (for instance, you might protect a Wordpress installation this way and automatically block known Wordpress exploits). We can build a new type of firewall - a “behavioral” firewall, which learns the behaviors of the devices inside its security perimeter. The behaviors of general purpose computers are too broad for it to do much for them, but for all the awful, vulnerable Internet of Things devices out there, it could do wonders. Machine Learning plays a vital role in this scenario. It wouldn’t be practical for humans to figure out what all the devices are and then write down rules for their expected behaviors. Instead the firewall can probe the devices and use Machine Learning to first classify them and second learn and confirm the behaviors for devices in their class. That’s likely more oomph than we’re going to put in the firewall itself but by sharing the classifiers we gain a huge advantage - when you install a wifi light switch I’ve already installed and the Machine Learner has already classified and learned, you get immediate protection. When the firewall observes unusual behavior from your wifi light switch - boom. Block it. This protects you from having it exfiltrate data it might have eavesdropped upon and it protects the Internet from it attacking infrastructure. And if you’ve spent the money on smart switches and access points, they can block its access to the rest of your devices, saving them from potential infection. That’s one role Machine Learning can play. You can imagine taking this kind of behavioral analysis and applying it in other areas - to app-generated traffic on smart phones and tablets, for instance. Even with the huge amount of press and attention Machine Learning is getting these days, we’re just at the start of what it can do. I think we’ll be finding some amazing new applications for it over the next few years, and security will be just one area ripe for innovation."}

Which is why even using a VPN is not a complete guarantee of bypassing it. Similar applications would include Quality of Service, firewalls and intrusion detection systems. It’s hard to categorize network traffic automatically, usually such software is configured manually or requires a paid subscription to receive signature updates. Machine learning can help with that. And, of course, antivirus heuristics already benefit from machine learning. A small difference in code can render a malware signature ineffective, but a heuristic might still flag it as suspicious."}

At the same time, it’s impossible to effectively deploy machine learning without a comprehensive, rich and complete approach to the underlying data. Why has machine learning become so critical to cybersecurity? Several reasons. With machine learning, cybersecurity systems can analyse patterns and learn from them to help prevent similar attacks and respond to changing behaviour. It can help cybersecurity teams be more proactive in preventing threats and responding to active attacks in real time. It can reduce the amount of time spent on routine tasks and enable organizations to use their resources more strategically. In short, machine learning can make cybersecurity simpler, more proactive, less expensive and far more effective . But it can only do those things if the underlying data that supports the machine learning provides the complete picture of the environment. As they say, garbage in, garbage out."}

At the same time, it’s impossible to effectively deploy machine learning without a comprehensive, rich and complete approach to the underlying data. With machine learning, cybersecurity systems can analyze patterns and learn from them to help prevent similar attacks and respond to changing behavior. It can help cybersecurity teams be more proactive in preventing threats and responding to active attacks in real time. Machine learning can make cybersecurity simpler, more proactive, less expensive and far more effective. Machine learning is about developing patterns and manipulating those patterns with algorithms. In order to develop patterns, you need a lot of rich data from everywhere because the data needs to represent as many potential outcomes from as many potential scenarios as possible. Following key areas could be a great help. Collecting, Organizing and Structuring Data “It’s about how you collect, organize and structure the data,” Engel said. “What you collect has to contain information about everything that happened, not just the threats. It has to be rich enough to provide details about machines, applications, protocols, network sensors. It needs to correlate what happened between what you see on the network and what you see at the endpoint. Asking the Right Questions This means posing the right questions to their colleagues on the technology and cybersecurity sides. Likewise: Do they have the right data to respond to an active attack? What kind of data are they collecting—do they have information on the network, on the endpoints, on the various clouds in which data and applications are deployed? Is the data structured in a way that can be used for decision-making and detection, or is it just sitting there? Can they effectively leverage data that comes from multiple sources? Are your teams confident that in using their data they can detect any attacks in the network? Are they using automation for detection as well as response? When it comes to cybersecurity, however, the potential for machine learning to have a dramatic and lasting impact is real."}

Or are you asking as an outside observer who doesn’t understand the connection between machine learning and security? If you mean the first question, then look for positions at security companies that are looking for your skillset. The process is no different from anyone else with a particular set of skills looking to work in a specific industry—there is nothing magic about either ML or information security. If you mean the second question, then think about the aspects of computer security that lend themselves to help from machine learning algorithms. For example, a very real problem for people protecting the security of large corporations is alert fatigue. In other words, an infosec pro at a large corporation has a firehose of alerts bombarding them at all times. Too many, in fact. This is a problem because the infosec pro has to sift through this barrage of alerts looking for the one that is really important. A ha! That’s a job that a good machine learning algorithm might be able to assist with—looking at all the alerts and weighting them from most important to least important at any given moment. That’s one example, there are probably others that you can think of."}

All of the NGAVs utilize some form of machine learning to keep up with the latest threats. Be careful though. Some of the advanced features in certain NGAVs WILL break things in your environment. Perfect example: Our NGAV keeps removing Anyconnect VPN from our laptops, because it sees it as a Potentially Unsafe Program. It is doing this despite the fact that we have whitelisted the app in every feature of the NGAV. So (moral of the story) make sure the machine learning in AV is learning the right things."}
