This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

YouTube has made learning simple and enjoyable. It can be helpful to learn the fundamentals of machine learning through YouTube, but there are a few things to consider before you begin your YouTube quest. Many YouTube channels offer free beginner-friendly information, however many videos are of poor quality and relevance to those just starting out with their first projects or who want to learn more about particular subjects like machine learning, data science, etc.. When it comes to learning something new, most people who use YouTube for learning struggle because they lack access to the most recent updates. As a result, they waste a lot of time experimenting with different approaches before settling on one that suits them well enough to move on to the next topic in those same classes. Watching Youtube videos for ML and DS is a good option but not the best one. If you want to start learning about machine learning and data science, these channels will help you do that. All of them are really good in what they do but some are better than others. I would recommend watching any of them as long as they have a high number of subscribers and Likes on their videos. Instead of watching Youtube videos, I suggest that you learn Machine Learning or Data Science from a reputable training institute. There are plenty of training institutes that offer high-quality ML and data science courses. Some of them are: Scaler Academy Tutort Academy upGrad Simplilearn Coursera When choosing a data science course, take into account the following variables to evaluate which institute is best for you. These various considerations include the following: Live Classes: During a live class, one can have 1:1 interaction with the teacher, clear your doubts, and understand the topic far better than in recorded videos. Mentors and instructors with experience who are knowledgeable about the subject matter and who can help you with both theory and practical issues. Real-time projects that will allow you to have better practical knowledge of these concepts. Placement support is the most vital one to look for. With better placement support, one can easily land their dream job. A professional-level course rather than a degree-type course. Small Batch Size to increase interaction between students and mentors. Interview Preparation guidance to help students crack their dream job. Profile Optimization facility to make their profile ideally fit for the job. Affordable course fees After reviewing the above criteria, I found Tutort Academy to be the only institute offering all of these features for learners in addition to other exciting learner-friendly features. While other institutes such as Scaler Academy, upGrad, Simplilearn and Coursera offer similarly good services but lack one or the other aspects listed above. Concluding my part, if I were asked to enroll in any of the institutes then, I will pick Tutort Academy as a working professional as it will be far easy for me to learn even if I have technical skills or not. Hope I could help you."}

Drawbacks of learning from YouTube channels: YouTube videos are often standalone tutorials or demonstrations, which may lack a cohesive and structured learning path. This can make it challenging to progress systematically and build a comprehensive understanding of the subject. YouTube videos typically have time constraints, which may limit the depth and breadth of topics covered. Complex concepts or advanced techniques may not be adequately explained, leaving gaps in understanding for learners seeking more in-depth knowledge. YouTube videos have limited opportunities for hands-on exercises, practice problems, or direct engagement with instructors or peers. YouTube channels generally do not provide personalized support or guidance. If you have questions or need clarification, it may be challenging to obtain immediate assistance or engage in discussions with experts or fellow learners. Data science and machine learning are dynamic fields with continuous advancements. YouTube videos may not always reflect the latest trends, techniques, or tools, as they can become outdated relatively quickly. Hence, in addition to the discussed channels, there are also many great online courses available that can teach you the skills you need to become a data scientist and machine learning engineer.
