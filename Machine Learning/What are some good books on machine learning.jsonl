Please leave comments and tell me what's wrong and/or what is missing -- right now it's a pretty small list so I've surely left something off. Introductory remarks I think of most of ML as a contribution to the question of how we can perform statistical inference. So I will attempt to describe these books in terms of how they approach this problem ( e.g. , whether they are theoretical or practical, frequentist or Bayesian, and so on). Some of them will not be about ML per se , but will be about subjects on which ML people depend greatly. Generally I judge this based on whether you could publish something about it at a conference like NIPS or ICML, or whether ML people are likely to make up a significant amount of the audience when talks are delivered on the subject. In no particular order: Foundations of Machine Learning, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Ameet Talwalkar An ambitious book that covers an impressive subset of the theoretical basis of machine learning. Includes excellent treatment of fundamentals (learning complexity, kernel methods, boosting, PAC learning, regression), as well as some subects that are almost never covered properly (ranking, multiclass, online). Additionally gives a nice ML perspective of some things (JL-lemma) that usually are not talked about well in textbooks. Learning From Data, Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Hsuan-Tien Lin Sort of like Foundations of Machine Learning, but seems to be built for an undergrad curriculum. Contains stuff about the theoretical underpinnings, but omits the more complicated theory. It is well-written and intuitive, with theoretically intense parts clearly marked and roped off for those who are, e.g. , too mathematically \"young.\" Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms, David J. C. MacKay [ free pdf ] A presentation of statistical modeling that is unified across information theory, coding theory, statistics, physics, ML, computational biology, cryptography, and signal processing. It is fantastically and uniquely illuminating. Contains my favorite treatment of many subjects (Ising models, Monte Carlo methods, fountaint codes, etc .). All of Statistics, Larry Wasserman Most of ML is collected into a series of tasks (regression, classification, clustering, etc .) whose only commonality is that they are types of statistical inference. Among the virtues of this remarkable book is that it approaches the subject of statistical inference in a very general fashion, and in a way that is graceful and approachable, but still rigorous. This is a good starting point for ML, as most of ML is a specialization of some subset of the topics presented here. IMO, it is the best book of its type. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, Kevin P. Murphy Mostly a roundup of the recent explosion in Bayesian inference. Unlike other books on this list, ML:APP seems to have been assembled by collecting papers, stapling them all together, making the notation consistent, and adding a bit of glue to unify them. For example, most of the figures are pulled (with permission) directly from other papers. This is not a bad thing! I'm very glad someone did it. But it does sometimes feel rushed, and there are many typos. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Christopher M. Bishop Bishop's book is useful mainly because it is quite thorough, and contains a good treatment of many of the esoteric corners of well-known methods. But I also found it to be quite dense, and often didn't understand exactly what Bishop was saying, or how he derived something. I find that it is very useful when I consult it about a subject after having already read 2 or 3 other texts. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman [ pdf ] The quintessential (frequentist) ML text. It's more computationally-minded than I would have expected from classically trained statisticians, but its lack of robustly Bayesian material dates it in some ways. (I'm not saying one perspective is better, I'm saing you should know both. Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques, Daphne Koller, Nir Friedman A dense, comprehensive, and canonical treatment of graphical models. Covers Markov Random Fields, Contitional Random fields, Bayes nets, and so on. Gaussian Processes For Machine Learning, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Christopher K. I. Williams [ free pdf ] The classical treatment of the Gaussian process, an important class of statistical model. If you enjoyed this, you might like my Quora blog , which is mainly about this type of thing."}

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

I prefer understanding and then using concepts rather than just using. Therefore, I cannot stress the importance of learning Mathematics enough.Specifically, you need to have a thorough grounding in Linear Algebra and Analysis. Since you're in 8th, I suggest you begin with the 11th and then the 12th stuff right away (don't worry, you can do it - it's not particularly challenging). Once done, get Strang's Linear Algebra and its Applications and watch his course videos available on MIT OCW. Do the homework problems and the exams. Implement as many algos as possible from what you learn in the course - from Gaussian Elimination to SVD. Then, begin with Apostol's Calculus - both the volumes. After that go through baby Rudin. Then implement algos from Golub's Matrix Computations. 4. After this you can pick up Sheldon Ross' Probability and then Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie et al. 5. Go to Coursera : Andrew Ng's ML course. If you find it elementary, you may also watch the full lectures available on You Tube. Implement what you learn. That should take care of the basics. Now you may go through Bishop and Hart and all the list of classics commonly available.  After that you may also want to go through the ICML and NIPS papers. EDIT : Therefore : 1. Get a basic handle on Python - implementing simple algos 2. Go through Strang's Linear Algebra and its Applications. Do the homework and exam questions from the OCW. 3. Implement the algorithms from Strang on Python 4. Finish both the volumes of Apostol and then Baby Rudin. 5. Get Golub's Matrix Computations and implement the algos therein. 6. Study Sheldon Ross' Probability and then Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie et al. 7. After 1-6 : Andrew Ng's ML course on You Tube. 8.  Then the following : Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning David Barber's Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning Kevin Murphy's Machine learning: a Probabilistic Perspective 9. ICML and NIPS Papers. If there are any specific things you want to ask about, feel free. I'll try my best. EDIT # Some papers you could study after 1-9 : 1.

I also believe it is important to not just look at a list of books without any curation, and instead get information about what the books give you and if they are a good fit for what you want to learn. With that in my mind, here are my picks: An introductory book: If you are going to get one book, and one book only, I suggest getting Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron . This has the a great balance of breadth and depth, and feels like a text book. After you read this book and do the programming exercises, you should at least have some kind of roadmap in your head about different facets of machine learning and can then diversify. I really like how up to date it is as well as of late 2019. A book about an ML framework: I recommend Deep Learning with Python by François Chollet . This has a deeper focus on using Keras as a framework for development, and if you are going to use Keras for development, you’ll learn lots of tips and tricks and also get a feel for how to write idiomatic Keras code. You might want to hold on for the 2nd edition - the code works as is for Tensorflow 1, though a second edition is in the works . A book about how to build an ML framework: If you are doing any work in ML, you’ll often take what the framework provides to you for granted. To really be a good programmer, you should have an appreciation of the building blocks you build upon. For this, I suggest Grokking Deep Learning . The focus of this book is not to use a framework, but rather to build one from scratch, and even if you are never going to build your own framework, it will give you a better appreciation of say how automatic differentiation works. A book for deeper theoretical foundation: For a deeper conceptual understanding, I recommend Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow . Personally, I learn better when I go into theory post some basic implementation, though if you want to do theory first, then you can start here. A book to review concepts: I recommend The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book . This book is very terse, and does a great job of summarizing a lot of machine learning concepts, so it’s great for rereading about a concept. Though I think some of the other books are better for going into more details and getting your hands dirty with hands on projects. This has some of the best explanations in a book. Also, do not get the Kindle / eBook versions of these books - there are lots of diagrams which are really better captured in a physical medium. While there is some overlap in these topics between the different books, they all have their own flavor and for the most part the areas that are complementary. Also, I’ve found I will learn better when I try to learn about the same material explained in different ways. [ I wrote this from the perspective of a practitioner who wants to use Keras / Tensorflow, so this answer doesn’t really cover PyTorch which is also really popular]"}

CMake projects are supported through and through, but other build systems are also supported: you can work with Makefiles, autotools, Meson, Bazel, and compilation databases. CLion provides several options for remote development, which cover most scenarios, including those with WSL and Docker. There’s no need to build a complicated chain of steps to get your remote flow working. Embedded development is supported, too. For some cases, all the steps are covered for you. Create a project from the template, write code with assistance, build, flash, run/debug, and even view the peripherals – all without leaving the IDE. CLion’s editor is super smart. Features like automated refactorings, completion hints, and code generation are great time-savers. All editor actions are context-aware, so you only get the relevant suggestions. CLion monitors code as you type, making it easy to spot errors on the fly. For dynamic analysis, there’s integration with the performance profiler, code coverage tool, and Valgrind analyzer to help you catch runtime errors. The debugger is equipped with all the necessities like stepping actions, variables and threads, hex view, and more. But CLion also adds a lot of its own advantages. You can view memory and disassembly, attach to processes, and debug core dumps and CMake scripts. If you need to dig into assembly without running your code, you can do that, too. When it comes to testing, CLion provides full integration with Boost, Google Test, Catch, and Doctest. Writing tests is quick and easy, and CLion’s test runner helps you run, debug, and analyze them. CLion also comes with JetBrains AI Assistant, which will help you with anything you need – from understanding errors to polishing your commit messages. Finally, the CLion team always responds to feature requests, bug reports, and support messages. In summary, CLion is a comprehensive but not overly complex tool created by experts, and it continues to evolve and become more and more refined."}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

Apologies and feel free to skip if you are one of those who wants a Twitter style 140 character answer. By and large, and I don’t mean to offend anyone, I don't like any of the textbooks in machine learning. For 15 years, I taught the fall introductory course in machine learning for graduate students at UMass, Amherst. It was a wonderful way to keep current in the field, as well as to shore up one’s basic foundations in math, statistics, and optimization. Sadly, I found none of the current books do justice to the breadth of topics that constitutes modern machine learning. For example, I find it sacrilegious that all the texts avoid any mention of reinforcement learning. Really? I mean, how far can one get in building AI learning systems without RL? Unless you believe that when you began to learn as a baby, your parents kept around large stashes of labeled training data for you to pore over every day. Hmmm.. good luck with that. Strike one! The second problem is that most books begin by essentially giving you in chapter 1, a dictionary of probability distributions to essentially “memorize”. If there’s a worse way to teach machine learning, I don’t know what that would be. As the work on deep learning should convince everyone, one can get very far in machine learning without having to explicitly appeal to machinations involving the multivariate normal distribution or the exponential family. While no one doubts the value of probability distributions, they don’t have to introduced at the beginning. Strike two! Finally, most of the standard books do a relatively poor job of explaining basic ideas in statistics. Take the classic EM algorithm. Every book in ML that I know introduces EM in the context of relatively complex problems, like mixture models or HMMs. This is in fact not the way EM was developed in statistics, but it was developed for much simpler problems where the basic intuition of EM is much easier to grasp (e.g., assume you can observe only 90% of the samples from a 1-dimensional Gaussian (normal distribution) with unknown mean and variance, and 10% of the samples are “missing”. What do you do? It’s quite easy to think of beginning with a simple idea like filling in an initial mean for all unobserved samples, and writing out a recurrence relation. One can easily show this EM method converges to maximize observed data likelihood. ). Books on EM in statistics are far better at explaining the full richness of EM. Strike three! So, how is one to cope in the interim, while we wait for someone to write the ideal ML textbook (which doesn't suffer the three gotchas above). Learning machine learning can be analogized to a travel vacation, where you have 3 months to learn about a foreign destination, say Europe. So, where do you go, and how much time do you spend in each place? You could spend all 3 months in London or Paris, but that would not teach you what Europe is (this is essentially what a lot of ML textbooks currently do, they focus on the one topic that the author(s) happen to expert at). You could sign up for one of these crazy guided tours, which takes you to a new city every other day. You would certainly see a lot of Europe this way, but you would be exhausted at the end of it, and probably not remember very much (and most of your time would be inside a bus or a train). So, some compromise between breadth and depth is obviously called for. First, understand what the broad scope of machine learning is. It includes many fields, ranging from supervised learning (the most well studied, and as far as biology goes, the most unnatural and implausible approach), to unsupervised learning (extremely important in biology as well as ML), and reinforcement learning (hugely important in biology, well studied in ML, ignored by ML textbook writers). Before learning ML methods, and I can't emphasize this enough, learn the ML problem formulations! Einstein was once asked what he would do if he had one hour to live, and was told his life depended on solving some problem. He said he would take 55 minutes to understand the problem and ask the right question(s). In the remaining 5 minutes, he would spend solving the problem. This is a good lesson to keep in mind. Far too many students of ML get obsessed over methods. Realize that methods change all the time. Problems rarely change. Far better to learn things that don’t change first than obsess over things that change every month or year. My approach gradually evolved to become what was exactly the opposite of modern textbook writers. I began with unsupervised learning, because I consider this the foundation of all biological and machine learning. In the beginning, when you are born, and are barely functional (except bawling), labels make little sense. Your parents can whisper sweet nothings in your ears, and attach labels to objects all they can, but devoid of language and meaning, these make no sense to you. Clearly, this is the crucial stage where basic representations get learned (and there is a lot of neuroscience to back this up). So, learning representations is the basic problem. Start by learning the simplest methods, like principal components analysis (PCA), and canonical correlational analysis (CCA) for multiple datasets. Progress to more sophisticated methods that exploit the geometry of the data space, such as manifold learning methods (e..g, Laplacian eigenmaps). The need for a good dose of basic math (linear algebra) will become quickly clear to you. Some basic neural implementations of methods like PCA will be helpful in seeing how to turn batch type methods into incremental gradient type methods. Once unsupervised learning methods are broadly understood, progress to reinforcement learning. This is the stage where babies begin to crawl around, learning to walk, and simple behaviors are mastered (picking up objects, still with no sense of what they are called or what “language” is). A good understanding of basic reinforcement learning will help also make the connection between machine learning and AI, robotics, and control theory. Sutton and Barto’s textbook on RL should be on everyone’s reading list. Eminently readable and highly engaging. A new edition is in the works and should be coming out soon. Finally, supervised learning can be studied, and there are of course a zillion methods and approaches, all clamoring to be heard. How to make sense of them all? A golden rule is that by and large, the simpler the method, the more longer lasting it will be, and the wider it will be used. Everyone should learn and master linear models of classification and regression, and linear models are by far still the most widely used models in science. Why? Because they are interpretable and understandable. Scientists care about explainability ultimately, not accuracy. I can’t resist quoting the great Nobel-prizewinning economist Ronald Coase, who till recently taught at the University of Chicago (one of the best economics departments in the world). He said, and I quote: “•A theory is not like an airline or bus timetable. We are not interested simply in the accuracy of its predictions. A theory also serves as a base for thinking. It helps us to understand what is going on by enabling us to organize our thoughts. •Faced with a choice between a theory which predicts well but gives us little insight into how the system works and one which gives us this insight but predicts badly, I would choose the latter, and I am inclined to think that most economists would do the same.” This is in a nutshell, the central quandary in modern machine learning. The best methods in terms of experimental performance on artificial datasets, come from deep learning. Unfortunately, these are the very methods we understand the least, and are essentially opaque. Linear models, on the other hand, are extremely well understood, and very explainable. But, they don’t perform as well as deep learning methods. So, textbook writers face an additional quandary. They can cover the latest methods, but give up any hope of providing a rich theory and comprehensibility, or they can focus on simple linear models, provide a comprehensive theory and stress on explainability, but ignore the fact that the methods covered are not going to be the ones that win some “bake off” artificial competition. Coase says clearly what side of this debate he would choose. So, is there a “best” among the bad choices we do have? If forced to pick one book, I would choose “Learning from Data” by Abu-Mostafa and colleagues. It wisely sticks to things we understand well and can analyze well: linear models. It gives a great introduction to computational learning theory. It clearly explains basic concepts like overfitting. And finally, it does not “snow” you with probability distributions. Best of all, it is short and inexpensive. Learning From Data - A Short Course My second choice would have to be Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto’s timeless classic on reinforcement learning. Full of insight, and highly readable. It sets the standard by which all ML textbooks should be judged. Again, it is relatively short, relatively inexpensive, and a new edition is coming out soon…. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning): Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G. Barto: 9780262193986: Amazon.com: Books Which leaves one final book to recommend on the requested three books on ML shortlist. For this last choice, I would not pick an ML textbook, but rather something that nicely complements the above two choices. The central concept in statistics that ML students should learn is likelihood functions. If there is ONE idea everyone in ML should learn, it is why statistics does not equal probability. In my beginning lecture, I always ask students to tell me how statistics is different from probability theory. No one invariably gets this right. So, to understand this, I highly recommend this gem of a book called “In All Likelihood”. Amazon.com: In All Likelihood: Statistical Modelling and Inference Using Likelihood (9780199671229): Yudi Pawitan: Books Yudi Pawitan’s book is a gem, and uses many examples, most of them simple, to communicate the essence of likelihood functions. This is the one concept in statistics that separates it from probability theory, and it is central to machine learning. Again, a relatively cheap book, and very short in length! There you have it! All these three books are 1) short 2) inexpensive as textbooks go 3) very well written and have great reviews on Amazon. Whatever course you take to learn about “machine learning”, I envy you. This is an unforgettable experience, and my own journey began more than 35 years ago, when I discovered the book “Godel, Escher, Bach” by Douglas Hofstadter. It opened up a whole new world for me, one that I have spent most of my life happily exploring the ML problem. These days, I’m more interested in another topic, but this message is already getting too long, so that will remain for another day!"}

Kelleher, Brian Mac Namee, and Aoife D’Arcy These books are a wonderful option. But to learn in-depth and develop expertise to get into the field, you need to learn machine learning through a good course. Why joining a course is better? Lessons are livelier. A book will only contain text and pictures, whereas an online course may contain a variety of dynamic learning assets, such as videos, animations, gifs, slideshows, etc. Courses offer higher levels of participation. With the help of the facilitator, students can interact with an online course and ask questions or work out issues. Online courses make it simple to give extra resources. It is highly challenging to include printable worksheets, templates, or tools in a book that is printed on paper. Classes involve interaction. With a paper-based book, it is nearly hard to include interactive elements like quizzes, branching situations, clicking to disclose additional information, etc. in a course. A quality course is learner-centered. An online course should be learner-focused and convey ruthlessly pertinent knowledge to the students by implementing excellent learning design. There are various courses available today that can help you tremendously. One of the most popular machine learning courses is offered by Simplilearn. Let’s look at their features: Simplilearn is an excellent source for machine learning and artificial intelligence. A group of knowledgeable instructors at Simplilearn have many years of experience training people who desire to work in this industry. They offer a variety of educational films on topics like statistics and machine learning, but they also have a platform called Simplilearn Expert Live that simulates interviews and may be useful for interview practice. The drawback of this platform is that it does not provide training in particular domains. There are many other courses as well. One of the best machine learning courses in Bangalore is offered by Learnbay. Their courses can be accessed from anywhere, and they have excellent placement support. Let’s see why their courses are the best: A domain specialization module is included in Learnbay's Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program .
