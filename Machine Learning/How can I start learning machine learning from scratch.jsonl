This approach offers two primary advantages: Understanding the breadth of the field ensures you're not overlooking any crucial aspects, thereby enhancing your focus. Having a clear picture of the field's landscape simplifies the process of creating a mental map of your learning journey . To effectively immerse yourself in the field and refine your learning strategy, consider answering these three questions sequentially: What are the potential applications of Machine Learning? What do you aim to achieve with Machine Learning? How can you accomplish that specific goal? Answering these questions will help you concentrate on a specific, manageable learning objective while also providing a broader perspective. Let's delve deeper into each of these questions. What are the potential applications of Machine Learning? This question is quite expansive and the answer will evolve over time. The beauty of this curriculum is that each step allows you to explore the possibilities in the field. This exploration will help you develop a more nuanced understanding of Machine Learning. Even if your initial understanding isn't entirely accurate, it's better to have a rough idea than none at all . Here's a quick rundown of what you can achieve with machine learning, ranging from technical aspects to practical applications. Technical Machine Learning Topics Supervised Learning This involves training a model with input and labeled output. Once trained, the model should theoretically generate the correct output for a given input. Unsupervised Learning This involves providing the model with input data without any output, and asking it to identify patterns in the data. Reinforcement Learning This setup includes an agent, an environment, actions the agent can perform, and rewards. It's somewhat akin to training a dog with treats. Online Learning This can be either supervised or unsupervised. The unique aspect is that the model can be updated \"online\" as new data streams in. Transfer Learning This involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for a different learning task, significantly accelerating the learning process for the second task. Ensemble Learning This technique combines multiple trained predictors (either sequentially or by voting on the output) to create a final predictor. There are many more types of machine learning, but these provide a good starting point. Common Machine Learning Models Linear Regression This simple y = ax + b formula is surprisingly effective for many problems and should be the starting point for most analyses. Logistic Regression Despite its name, this is a classification model that calculates the probability of a class or multiple classes. Decision Tree This model creates a tree of decisions or formulas, which lead to the desired output when followed. These models are valuable because they are easy to understand and inspect once trained. Support Vector Machine (SVM) This model constructs a plane that separates two classes with maximum distance between them. It's a bit more complex than that, but envisioning a line with thickness is a good starting point. Naive Bayes These classifiers use Bayes' Theorem, which assumes that all features are independent. This is rarely the case, hence the term \"naive\". However, it performs surprisingly well in practice even when this assumption doesn't hold. k-nearest neighbors This classifier doesn't require training; it simply memorizes all elements in the dataset. It can then provide an output based on the distance of the input from other points in the dataset. K-Means This unsupervised model determines which points belong to which cluster, given a number of clusters. It does this by repeatedly adjusting the centroid of each cluster until it converges to a stable point. Random Forest This ensemble technique uses many simple decision tree classifiers. The model's output is the class output by the majority of decision trees. Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms These algorithms create a mapping from a dataset with many dimensions (features) to a representation with fewer dimensions. When it maps to 2 or 3 dimensions, it allows us to visualize a high-dimensional dataset in 2D or 3D. XGBoost This model is a regularized gradient boosted model. It has weak learners set up in series rather than in parallel (like random forest ). It's a very effective model and often a top performer in machine learning competitions. Deep Neural Network These models are a field unto themselves. They are weak predictors arranged both in series and in parallel. These models can construct a hierarchical representation of the data, yielding excellent results . However, they are notoriously difficult to train due to their high capacity. There are many possible architectures for these models, such as CNNs and Transformers. There are numerous machine learning models available. However, proficiency in machine learning doesn't require knowledge of all of them. In fact, if you understand Linear Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and some form of Deep Neural Network, you're well-equipped to tackle most problems . However, understanding how a model learns provides mental flexibility and allows you to approach problems from different angles. Common Applications of Machine Learning The applications of machine learning are constantly evolving and expanding. Essentially, any field that collects data can benefit from machine learning. Therefore, don't worry if your understanding of the possibilities seems superficial. Computer Vision Natural Language Processing (NLP) Medical Diagnosis Weather Forecasting This list could continue indefinitely. The goal here is to create a comprehensive map of the possibilities to guide the next phase of your learning journey. Tools for Machine Learning The following tools are commonly used in ML: Python for high-level programming Pandas for dataset manipulation Numpy for numerical computing on CPU Scikit-learn for non-deep learning machine learning models Tensorflow or Pytorch for Deep Learning machine learning models Higher-level wrapper Deep Learning libraries like Keras Basic Git for project management Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for code experimentation There are many more tools available, but don't stress about staying up-to-date with the latest library. The technologies listed above are sufficient for most projects. However, you may need to add some libraries to your stack if they are specialized for your field of study. Resources The above mentioned technologies can be followed by anyone and everything is available on the internet, although it can be a tedious task and an individual can get distracted easily.

So start by polishing up your maths skills. ML currently is a very hot area with many more people trying to learn it but most don't understand that the underlying principles in machine learning are that of optimization theory in maths. Thus to give you a boost revisit the prerequisites. Maths : Linear algebra: Make sure you are comfortable with matrices, vectors and singular value decomposition (SVD). Calculus: Especially differential calculus, become comfortable with evaluation of derivatives of any function and learn chain rule. Numerical optimization: Like I said above ML is currently more related to numerical optimization than anything else. Most optimization methods are variants of gradient descent such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). So learn about first order and second order optimization methods. Statistics and probability: Bayes theorem, random variables, probability distribution functions such as the Binomial and Gaussian distributions. Sigmoid and softmax functions are motivated by probability. Programming : In any of the following: Python: Is an easy to learn scripted language that you can quickly pick up for the purpose of practicing what you are learning. Python has a lot of ML libraries supporting it thus it is ideal not only for beginners but also for experts. Java: is a fairly high-level language that is fairly easy to learn but not as easy as Python. It also has a lot of ML libraries supporting it. C/C++: Don't mess with this one at beginner level but start getting used to writing ML code from scratch as you advance so that you can learn more details about most ML algorithms. It is recommended to build your own mini-ML library at some point in your learning journey using such low-level high-performance languages. With that said, there are several roadmaps to reaching your destination. I can split them up into three stages. Beginner stage. Intermediary stage. Advanced (expert) stage. Beginner stage : The beginning part has been partially covered above, begin with maths. And if you are not good at maths you will need to make sure you are good. Thus make sure to sharpen the axe before starting to chop down the tree. Maths is very important for learning ML as most of the times, systems are expressed in mathematical terms. So before starting, please go through the basics. Don't worry about forgetting something along the way, you can always go back to revisit the stuff you have forgotten, this is not an exam. This is where you also have to set yourself up for success in ML, so I suggest you skim through the basic concepts of ML and the book [1] by Ian Goodfellow and others is an excellent book to introduce you to ML and the current hot area in ML called deep learning (DL). Go through the book in any order you like but make sure to read the introduction first. At beginner level is also the time to sharpen up another axe, programming. Practice coding on problems that are not even related to ML so that you can learn the syntax of that language. You can't learn coding by reading but through practice. Python being English-like is very easy to pick up and there are a lot of resources out there teaching Python coding. Just Google and you will find high quality tutorials on Python programming. In fact your best way to learn coding is to just jump directly to coding and just Google and Stackoverflow your way through learning the syntax of the language. Every modern programmer owes their project completions to Google and Stackoverflow, let no one lie to you, we are in an era of powerful ‚Äúcheating‚Äù tools like Google search. Don't just copy and paste though, understand the solutions you find online and code your own versions afterwards. If you can't code a matrix operation in Python just Google and try to understand what others did. Sometimes very basic code can be just copied and pasted. Also go through the TensorFlow (TF) tutorials as well. They will not only introduce you to TF but also to the concepts of ML such as linear and logistic regression. Intermediary stage : At this stage you should have already read several online sources such as articles, books and watched several YouTube videos on ML and you should have coded up some models at high-level using libraries like TF. Now it is time to start moving forward, you need to make sure that that knowledge does not slip away, you need to consolidate that knowledge in your mind. This is where things start to get interesting because you need to now ask yourself, can I implement backpropagation algorithm from scratch? You will notice that you probably wouldn't, that's okay. You need at this point to start pursuing proofs like deriving mathematical expressions you find while reading ML literature. Try to derive backprop for simple neural networks yourself from your own perspective and understanding and see if you can translate that maths to actual working code. Try to also implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) from scratch. This is where you start to build your mini-ML library. You will be able to learn a great deal of detail about ML this way. Implement stochastic gradient descent and train your own ML models using your own mini-ML library and debug until the models work comparable to those from mature libraries like TF. Open source the mini-ML library afterwards to further show off your skills to potential employers or for the purpose of getting into the Google Brain residency program for example. You also need to start reading journal after journal at this point. At first it will be hard but with more reading and rereading you will start to understand even complex journals from the likes of DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft, Facebook and Google. If you start to understand journals it means you are advancing well towards your goal. Advanced stage : Yes coding your own mini-ML library is sort of like reinventing the wheel but it is essential for learning the details of the most important underlying concepts in machine learning but not sufficient to make you an expert. This advanced stage comes after spending a few years in the intermediary stage. In the advanced stage you need to start paying attention to your own intuitions and ideas. Build or start working on actual novel ML algorithms. You will need to empirically or theoretically validate your ideas by implementing them and doing lots of experiments. It is somewhat hard to design a novel ML algorithm as the ideas come, in form of a eureka moment, after years or months of thinking and lots of research work. This is why being at an advanced level requires that you have built up a strong mental model of the field of ML from a variety of angles. You don't have to be an expert programmer though, as the coding skills only need to help you implement your models. At this stage start asking and pursuing deep questions to which there are no answers yet. Focus on areas that are counterintuitive and try to come up with more novel intuitive solutions to those areas. It is like a PhD program. That is a possible roadmap for someone trying to learn ML. It is also important to practice by explaining complex ML systems to someone else. Quora is a great place for answering ML related questions, that way you will be able to consolidate your knowledge when explaining the ML algorithms to others, it's a win-win situation, you help others while you gain and consolidate knowledge yourself. The other thing worth noting is that you really need to be passionate about the ML field otherwise it won‚Äôt be easy. You also need to have tenacity because some concepts take long to understand fully, you may think that you get a concept up until it's time to implement it yourself. Thus learning ML especially by yourself requires serious discipline and focus. You can only maintain that focus if you are passionate and determined to learn ML. With that said the journey itself is quite fun, fulfilling and challenging, not hard but challenging just keep going and read anything that interests you concerning ML. Be passionately curious, you will get there. Hope this helps. Footnotes [1] Deep Learning"}
