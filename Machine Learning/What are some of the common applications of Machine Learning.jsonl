It is a field with a number of openings and has a huge impact on the way the present world functions. The applications of Machine Learning are present in multiple forms. Some of these essential ML applications include - Social Media features - Machine learning algorithms are incorporated in social media in order to create excellent and attractive features. For example, the friends suggestion options in different social media like Facebook and Instagram are taken from your activity and likes among others. Product Recommendations - Many websites employ this technique and the ads target your cart history and websites visited in order to figure out the products that you like. While this was perceived as an eerie occurrence earlier it is now well understood that websites employ this technique and we also benefit from the same. Image Recognition - This is also considered as one of the most notable features of machine learning. It is also being adopted for further analytical methods like pattern recognition, face recognition, and face detection. Sentiment Analysis - This is a real-time application of machine learning which is used in order to accurately detect the mood or opinion of the speaker/writer. Sentiment analysis can be employed in an email, a review based website, and others. Some other applications of Machine Learning also include - Automation of Employee Access Control Marine Wildlife Preservation Prediction of Potential Heart Failure Regulation of Healthcare Efficiency and Medical Services Banking Domain In order to learn about Machine Learning in depth and prepare yourself for the role of a Machine Learning (ML) engineer, you should choose an online course like the Result Oriented Courses for Working Professionals offered by Tutort Academy.

Following are some of the examples of machine learning which we use everyday.. 1)Virtual Personal Assistants Siri, Alexa, Google Now are some of the popular examples of virtual personal assistants. As the name suggests, they assist in finding information, when asked over voice. All you need to do is activate them and ask a question or instruct them to do a certain task. To answer you, these assistants look for previously stored data and related questions. Machine learning is an important part of these personal assistants as they collect and refine the information on the basis of your previous involvement with them. Later, this data is used to find answers for your queries or to perform other tasks. 2)Predictions while Commuting Traffic predictions : We all have beein using GPS Navigation service.While we do that, our current locations and velocities are being saved at a central server for managing traffic. This data is then used to build a map of current traffic. This helps in preventing the traffic and does congestion analysis.Machine learning in such scenarios helps to estimate the regions where congestion can be found on the basis of daily experiences. 3)Videos Surveillance The video surveillance system nowadays are powered by AI that makes it possible to detect crime before they happen. They track unusual behaviour of people like standing motionless for a long time, stumbling, or napping on benches etc. The system can thus give an alert to human attendants, which can ultimately help to avoid mishaps. And when such activities are reported and counted to be true, they help to improve the surveillance services. This happens with machine learning doing its job at the backend. 4)Social Media Services From personalizing your news feed to better ads targeting, social media platforms are utilizing machine learning for their own and user benefits. People You May Know : Machine learning works on a simple concept: understanding with experiences. Facebook continuously notices the friends that you connect with, the profiles that you visit very often, your interests, workplace, or a group that you share with someone etc. On the basis of continuous learning, a list of Facebook users are suggested that you can become friends with. Face Recognition : You upload a picture of you with a friend and Facebook instantly recognizes that friend. Facebook checks the poses and projections in the picture, notice the unique features, and then match them with the people in your friend list. The entire process at the backend is complicated and takes care of the precision factor but seems to be a simple application of ML at the front end. Similar Pins : Machine learning is the core element of Computer Vision, which is a technique to extract useful information from images and videos. Pinterest uses computer vision to identify the objects (or pins) in the images and recommend similar pins accordingly. 5)Email Spam and Malware Filtering Over 325, 000 malwares are detected everyday and each piece of code is 90–98% similar to its previous versions. The system security programs that are powered by machine learning understand the coding pattern. Therefore, they detects new malware with 2–10% variation easily and offer protection against them. 6)Online Customer Support A number of websites nowadays offer the option to chat with customer support representative while they are navigating within the site. However, not every website has a live executive to answer your queries. In most of the cases, you talk to a chatbot. These bots tend to extract information from the website and present it to the customers. Meanwhile, the chatbots advances with time. They tend to understand the user queries better and serve them with better answers, which is possible due to its machine learning algorithms. 7)Search Engine Result Refining Google and other search engines use machine learning to improve the search results for you. Every time you execute a search, the algorithms at the backend keep a watch at how you respond to the results. If you open the top results and stay on the web page for long, the search engine assumes that the the results it displayed were in accordance to the query. Similarly, if you reach the second or third page of the search results but do not open any of the results, the search engine estimates that the results served did not match requirement. This way, the algorithms working at the backend improve the search results. 8)Product Recommendations You shopped for a product online few days back and then you keep receiving emails for shopping suggestions. If not this, then you might have noticed that the shopping website or the app recommends you some items that somehow matches with your taste. Certainly, this refines the shopping experience but did you know that it’s machine learning doing the magic for you? On the basis of your behaviour with the website/app, past purchases, items liked or added to cart, brand preferences etc., the product recommendations are made. 9)Online Fraud Detection Machine learning is proving its potential to make cyberspace a secure place and tracking monetary frauds online is one of its examples. For example: Paypal is using ML for protection against money laundering. The company uses a set of tools that helps them to compare millions of transactions taking place and distinguish between legitimate or illegitimate transactions taking place between the buyers and sellers.

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

Machine learning at this age allows the automation of singular tasks, whereas many jobs involve multiple tasks and even multitasking at level machine learning isn't capable of yet. Teaching and Learning Industry Computers can be programmed to determine individual study plans, specific to each student's needs. Algorithms can analyze test results, drastically reducing the time teachers spend in their leisure time on grading. A student's attendance and academic history can help determine gaps in knowledge and learning disabilities. These applications won't necessarily translate to a teacher less classroom though there is that hypothetical, as well, but will facilitate the teaching and learning environments to enhance the outcomes and ease the burden on both teacher and student. Legal and law industry Law firms are increasingly turning to machine learning to process massive amounts of data related to legal precedents. J.P. Morgan, for example, uses a software program dubbed Control Intelligence to review documents and previous cases in seconds that would otherwise take 360,000 hours. As with our teachers above, its unlikely machine learning or AI will replace lawyers any time soon, given the necessity of rebuttal and human logic or appeal, but the incorporation of machine learning will surely reduce the time taken to put together a case, and it could expedite trials, speeding up the processes of the court. Mechanical industry The automation of industries is the most obvious shift we can expect from machine learning. Functions and tasks that were once undertaken by trained workers are increasingly being mechanized; in particular jobs that involve some element of danger or potential harm, such as work in factories and mining. There are already driverless trucks operating in mining pits in Australia, operated remotely from a distant control center.More and more machinery is taking the place of labor. You need only visit your local supermarket to see more self service kiosks and fewer staff. But, here again, there is a limit to how far a person is willing to deal with a machine, and the human ability to quickly fix a problem isn't something machines are capable of yet. Medical industry Machine learning is taking a bigger part in our health and well being on a daily basis, and it is already being used for faster patient diagnosis. Even the prevention of illness in the first place have been aided by predicting the potential health problems one may be susceptible to, based on age, socio economic status, genetic history, etc. The use of programs to analyze and cross reference symptoms against databases containing millions of other cases and illnesses has led to faster diagnoses of illness and disease, saving lives through quicker treatment and decreasing the time a patient spends in the health system. Hospitals are currently using AI algorithms to more accurately detect tumors in radiology scans and analyze different moles for skin cancer, and machine learning is being adapted to accelerate research toward a cure for cancer. Transportation Industry The self control of our transport industries is steadily becoming more reliant on machine learning and AI, and it is expected that within the next decade, the majority of our shipping and rail networks will be controlled autonomously. China is currently testing driver less public buses. Rolls Royce and Google have teamed up to design and launch the world's first self driving ship by 2020. The vessel will use Google's Cloud Machine Learning Engine to track and identify objects at sea. While Google's self driving car replaces one driver, the autonomous ship's AI will need to carry out the tasks usually requiring a crew of 20."}
