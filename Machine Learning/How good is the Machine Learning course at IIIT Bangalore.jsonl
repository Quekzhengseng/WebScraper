In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

I have seen many courses which either cover Machine Learning or directly skip to Deep Learning. I came to know about this course by one of my friends who was pursuing PGD in Data Science from IIIT-B and UpGrad. I immediately inquired UpGrad about the course and I've got the course content from the team instantly. I was thoroughly impressed with the content as it covers from Basic Mathematics, statistics till Deep Learning, Graphical Models which is something I have been looking for and it is just not a certificate program, you will earn a PG Diploma. However, what made me choose this course was different. I've attended many courses through MOOC but many a times I either drop from the course or complete with no solid outcome. But, when my friend explained me how the course works then i decided to pursue it and once i started the course i realized that what my friend explained about the course was exactly reflected. One thing for sure is : ONE HAS TO BE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS COURSE. This is just not another MOOC course. It is a solid university course which demands your precious time albeit for your benefit. Below are the key points which made this course popular and unique. 1) It is year long course and at the same time very rigorous which itself says the depth and breadth of the course content. 2) Prerequisites like Mathematics, SQL and Python are well taught for more than a month even before the main course starts 3) Professors are extremely knowledgeable and often takes live sessions for any clarifications. 4) What works in favor of students to complete this Diploma is stringent timelines which followed very strictly. Modules are published on every Sunday and we need to complete it in a week. Failing to do so attract the penalty of marks. I think it motivates one to be alert and take the course seriously. 5) Checkpoint quizzes in between the module make sure that you understand the content well. Unless you answer the quiz, further section is not opened. 6) Assignments are frequent for every important topic and quality of the assignment is good. From the assignments, we really get to learn something about the real industry problems. 7) All the cohort students are connected through Discussion Forum which is a great platform to rectify one's academic related queries and is continuously monitored by the Teaching Assistants to maintain it relevant and clean. They also help us in clarifying academic queries. 8) Each student is assigned with a student mentor who is extremely helpful for any non-academic related queries or issues. 9) Frequent sessions by industry experts gives us opportunity to learn the how currently Machine Learning and AI is being applied for the industry problems and how we must be prepared for that. 10) Career guidance is provided by UpGrad and they do excellent work in arranging frequent base camps and career guidance sessions in the IIIT-B campus. One of the few complaints i have with the course is about the timelines. Being a working professional i sometimes get exhausted to meet the deadlines. But that’s how it works and over the time i got accustomed to it and feel may be this is the only way i can be on my toes. Other complaint is about the release of the modules. They won’t release the next module till Sunday of every week. This would be the hindrance for people who complete the module ahead of time and have to wait till the next week for the next module. Other than those, i am very happy with the way course is progressing so far and I highly recommend it."}

Here’s a little overview of how the curriculum looks like: Preparatory course: This one helps you get the foundations of Python, SQL, Mathematics, etc. strong before you jump into the exciting part, which is, the main content of the course. The mains: The course covers everything from basic machine learning intuition, the math behind the algorithms, all the way to building an E2E machine learning project pipeline. For my batch, we did not have the ML model deployment as part of the course but we have been assured it’ll be taken care of. The case studies are done within teams of 2. Case studies are quite a good way of getting your hands dirty with good problem statements to solve. Some require ALMOST and entire pipeline to be built, which includes data processing, data analysis, feature engineering, and model building. I found the course so far really good with the best faculties from IIIT-B teaching us. Some modules were also handled by ML Engineers/Data Scientists/CEOs which helps gain knowledge on the ‘how-tos’ of ML/DS approaches followed in the industry. Upgrad also provides career assistance by conducting 1:1 mentorship calls with an industry expert, resume building session, interview preprations, and sessions with industry experts to know how to break into this field, etc. They also post job openings on their portal too. They conduct basecamps too for batches to come together and basically have fun. I also found the support provided by Upgrad really good. Always responsive and considerate to our queries. Overall, a really great course to start with!"}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger. For Americans living overseas, the complexity is just bigger. Pained by financial indecision? Want to start investing? Reach out for assistance today!

Some backgroud first, I hold an experience of 12+ years in the area of Development, management and analytics. Somehow I got the chance to attend one of the corporate programs related to AI in my current organisation. This fuelled some fire in me to pursue more on ML/AI algorithms. I started studying some books on Machine Learning and luckily, I got chance to work in some data science projects (not in pure Machine Learning space, but atleast it was good enough to give me a start). Though I carry a decent exposure to Python, I got some more hands on into Python ML frameworks like sklearn etc. But I was always feeling to take up some academic course to connect the missing dots. There began the never-ending search and it didn’t end for like 10 months. There are so many courses that I got more confused rather than being convinced. I registered for a few from online platforms like coursera, udemy etc. but failed badly to complete those. Not because of the platforms, but rather my own schedule, habit of procrastination and some lack of motivation. Ultimately, one of my ex-colleagues, who happens to have a like-mindedness in this area and had done a thorough research on many other courses, discussed about PG diploma in ML/AI. Though still not 100% sure, I registered for the course and now I am almost 5+ months into it and here are some observations and experiences that may help you make some judgment in chosing the right course: The course starts with a pretty crisp preparatory course on Python for Data Science, Linear Algebra, SQL etc. The IIIT-B faculty is pretty good and that is one of the strongest positives about this course. They create the right balance of depth and breadth in terms of coverage and I think they possess a good amount of knowledge. Upgrad Learning platform provides an immersive experience. Upgrad provides a good support that helps in clearing doubts by arranging doubt-clearing sessions, industry sessions and through discussion forums. There are stringent timelines, so you absolutely need to keep up with the timelines. If you can’t afford 12-15 hrs per week, its going to be difficult. There are graded assessments after every session, so those test basic understanding of a particular algo or a topic. There are individual assignments and group case studies which help having a hands-on. A student mentor will be there to address academic and administrative concerns. Overall its a pretty good course and I fee it is rightly balanced. My only concern was that even though IIIT-B/upgrad expect a benchmark of 10 hours of commitment per week from students, that may not be sufficient for many. It will exceed even 15 hrs sometimes, but ultimately it depends on individuals and the depth they want cover. Overall, a positive feeling so far."}
