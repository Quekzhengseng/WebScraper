Level 1: Descriptive Analytics A description of the past is useful to gain insights. One example is customer segmentation. Many businesses are obviously interested in knowing who their customers are so they can target high-yielding segments. When you have thousands or millions of customers, this becomes nearly impossible for a human analyst. Algorithms like k-means clustering, a machine learning algorithm, could be used. The typical question is “what happened?” A version of this in our example would be “who were my customers ?” and “what did they buy?” Level 2: Diagnostic Analytics Once you know what happened, you are usually interested in knowing why it happened . Identifying causal relationships can be tricky, but a simple decision tree could be used to describe things like “customers in segment A buy lots of beer when they have bought hamburgers”. Level 3: Predictive Analytics Machine learning is usually associated with predictive analytics. Following our example, you might want to predict what will happen to the highly profitable beer sale if you remove the unprofitable hamburgers from the portfolio. Regression algorithms can be used for that. An often overlooked fact is that predictive analytics can also be used to say something about the present and past. For instance, when an unknown customer enters your store, you might want to know which segment the customer will belong to. This would require a classification algorithm. If you have incomplete information about one of your previous customers, you could predict what the customer bought in the past and fill in the missing details. “We know that this customer spent some money on hamburgers and some more money on a product that is missing from the records. Our prediction algorithm says that this was beer.” Level 4: Prescriptive Analytics This is in practice the rarest, but also the most valuable, form of analytics, where actions are either suggested by evidence or initiated directly. One example could be anomaly detection. If a new customer entering one of your stores is a potential VIP, notify the store clerk (decision support), or if it’s a suspected robber, shut the doors automatically (decision automation). The latter example is not very realistic but you get the idea. Prescriptive analytics is also the domain of reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence. Algorithms can answer questions such as “which products should the business offer at discounted prices in the next two weeks?” or the algorithm could adjust the prices automatically."}

The approach can be used for tasks such as spam filtering, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). This AI-based method has also been incorporated into other applications including self-driving cars, personal assistants, and online advertising. Machine learning systems adapt through experience over time, meaning that they improve with every additional dose of information or training. The machine's behavior is determined by algorithms that encode its experiences. For instance, the algorithms can be used for predictions about outcomes based on previously observed inputs and outputs. In essence, a machine learning algorithm treats its own experience as data to be analyzed in order to infer answers. Machine Learning: Where does it appear? In the broadest sense, we can talk about machine learning in two major contexts- Generalized AI and Application Specific AI. Generalized AI, or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), is the type of intelligence that aims to produce human-like behavior such as a robot performing a useful service, an information filtering system on the web providing search results just like Google, or a self-driving car driving us to our destination without hitting any pedestrians. Application-Specific AI is aimed at solving one specific problem. In this context, there are two types: Deep Machine Learning: This approach involves training deep neural networks to learn from large amounts of data and then use this learning to solve problems. Supervised Machine Learning: In supervised machine learning, the system is trained on a set of examples that have been manually labeled by humans. The labels are then used to train a predictive model which can be used for classification or regression tasks in applications such as document classification, spam detection, image recognition, etc. Machine Learning: How does it work? Machine learning algorithms typically need two things in order to operate- training data and a function called an objective. Training data consists of an input vector (a sequence), along with its correct output value, according to some objective function. This input includes both constant values and values generated randomly by the machine for testing purposes. The machine then uses the training data in order to try and find an input-output mapping that will produce the correct output every time. For example, consider a binary classifier (this is a classification algorithm that outputs only 0 or 1). It takes in data as an input and tries to predict which category it belongs to by looking at patterns found within the data. For instance, if we have pictures of dogs and cats labeled respectively as \"dog\" and \"cat\", our learning algorithm would be trained on this information so as to distinguish between them properly. We can say that the logic behind this process is: given any picture, predict whether it's of a dog or cat. The question here is how does one get these pictures of dogs and cats in the first place? They are labeled randomly by humans so that the machine can learn how to distinguish between them. Machine Learning: Characteristics Every machine learning algorithm is trained on a set of training data with a specific input-output mapping objective function or cost function. The choice of this function determines the quality of the model (since it measures tradeoffs). Costs functions used in ML algorithms typically aim at minimizing prediction error or maximizing classification accuracy. While many standard cost functions exist, they all differ slightly in their implementations. In terms of fairness towards different types of data points, some common metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and cross-entropy. All of these metrics try to measure how bad it is for an algorithm to classify one data point as belonging to a certain category when it actually belongs to a different category. In other words, they reward the machine's success rate while penalizing its failure rate. The cost function that is used will also vary depending on the type of problem that is being solved. The most famous types are classification problems and regression problems. In classification problems, the type of data is discrete- meaning there can be only one class or answer for every piece of information (examples include spam detection, face recognition, etc.). In regression problems, the type of data is continuous with an infinite number of possible answers- this means that every piece of information can be assigned multiple possible answers (examples include real-time price prediction, medical diagnosis, etc.). Machine Learning: Types of Algorithms To solve a given problem, practitioners must identify an appropriate learning algorithm to use. A general rule of thumb is that for classification problems we should choose algorithms with high accuracy and for regression problems we should choose algorithms that are accurate but more robust since absolute error rate isn't important. Here are some examples: Linear Regression: Linear regression uses the concept of linearity to predict continuous values based on a number of input variables. It minimizes the sum of squared error in order to achieve this. This type of algorithm tends to be fast and scalable for big data sets as it avoids iterating through all possible solutions; however, it is unstable. In a nutshell: Linear regression uses linearity to find an equation for predicting a continuous value based on 2 or more input variables. Logistic Regression: A binary classifier, logistic regression is used when there are only two possible outcomes (0/1). It minimizes the error rate of false positives and false negatives- this means that under no circumstances should we predict something true as false or vice versa. Neural Networks: In ML, neural networks are a tool in classification problems and incorporate concepts from neuroscience such as how human brains function. They're used when the data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value. Neural networks consist of multiple hidden layers of neurons with different activation functions at each layer and a final layer for producing results. They're used to solve problems that are non-linear or otherwise difficult to tackle using other algorithms. Neural Networks: two most common activation functions include sigmoid (also called logistic function) and step. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is known as the \"Northeast\" algorithm in several academic circles; it's widely considered to be the best supervised discriminative learning model available today for classification problems. It's particularly useful when there's only one target label, that data points are linearly separable/contiguous, and that samples from all classes are roughly the same size. However, SVM is also known to be unstable and expensive for most real-world problems. SVMs fall into either the linear or the non-linear category depending on whether their decision boundary corresponds to a hyperplane or not. Tree-based algorithms: Many classification problems can be represented as a tree structure where every internal node represents a test with boolean value and an edge between two nodes indicates that if we take the right path at one node we must go left at the other to get out of it (examples include C4.5, CHAID, etc.). Decision trees are used when data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value; they're designed through recursive binary splitting (splitting at the node with maximum information gain). Tree-based algorithms: C4.5 and CHAID are the two most popular examples of Decision Tree Learning. Boosting: Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that's often used when the data points have multiple independent dimensions but can take only one output value (examples include AdaBoost, GBDT, etc.). It basically involves training a number of weak classifiers by using some initial probability distribution and then combining them in order to deliver better results than what each individual classifier would deliver on its own. It was initially developed for tackling problems with imbalanced classes (where one class is present in much larger numbers compared to others)."}

For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again.

Another way to understand is through image recognition- it identifies the image and classifies it without any human intervention. To put this in perspective of data science, Machine Learning actually helps organisations go through and analyse a vast amount of data while gaining insights from them to make better and data-driven decisions for the future. Remember, this process is automated and happens without any human intervention, thanks to Machine Learning. Gone are the traditional statistical techniques, as Machine Learning has made analysing huge piles of data more manageable and accurate. It is also because of this new paradigm that Machine Learning has become a requirement for data science professionals. Why has Machine Learning been so popular? The reason why Machine Learning has been so popular is that it can process great numbers of data at a low cost. The abundance and cheap computation are one of the main reasons why it’s so widely accepted. In addition, tracking all of this data is itself a tiring process which is something that Machine Learning can handle with accuracy. Eventually, this makes solving data problems more effortless for organisations and helps them in areas such as understanding algorithms and monitoring customer behaviour.

Models and algorithms : understand supervised vs unsupervised learning, the differences between models and algorithms, and select a set of appropriate models. Performance evaluation: Understand the performance evaluation metrics for different types of use case, ground truth labelling, establish baseline performance. From there, they will also need to be able to define what it means by the result is not satisfying , as the requirements for different industries vary. They will need to know what to do next when the result is not satisfying, and how to take it to production if we are happy with the model. Contrary to popular belief, deep learning and Hadoop is NOT needed for you to know, at least at the very beginning when you decided to pursue a science career. Don’t get me wrong, there is no harm trying out the Keras or Tensorflow by implementing the sample tutorials, but never ever think that you are a data scientist or a machine learning engineer just because you can now recognize handwritten digit or tracking objects using YOLO. On the other hand, Hadoop is more of an infrastructure and data engineering problem, not a data science problem. Yes, Google and Facebook are using them in specific use cases, but most of the data science projects we are handling are not Google or Facebook scale, so you can pick it up later when the time comes. And you will know it when it comes"}
