Let me explain to you a few concepts that will give you a better understanding of the field you want to explore. Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. To put it simply: artificial intelligence provides computers with the ability to automatically perform tasks characteristic of human beings, such as perception, pattern recognition, and learning. Machine learning or machine intelligence is one particular branch of AI, where machines are able to learn without being explicitly programmed for each individual task. In other words, it's all about teaching computers how to learn on their own. There are three main strategies that fall under the umbrella of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised Learning: In this type of ML a computer learns from examples provided by a human expert, so that it can later generalize its knowledge – build rules or functions – based on those examples (supervised learning is also used in natural language processing to disentangle the underlying structure of words and phrases). Unsupervised Learning: In this type of ML, computers are presented with unlabeled data (data that hasn't been tagged or categorized), so they have to find patterns on their own – group similar examples together, determine which variables belong together. Reinforcement Learning: Is a sub-type of unsupervised machine learning. In this case, instead of grouping examples into common classes, the algorithm induces a function that maps states and actions to rewards (positive or negative feedback). Reinforcement learning algorithms typically learn by trial and error. As you can see, these three types of AI/ML are essentially the same (the only difference is in how you provide the computer with data), which is why they can be treated as one and the same. With that out of the way, let's talk about some of AI/ML's applications. For an application to qualify as AI, it has to incorporate at least some form of machine learning. However, many algorithms can be implemented using both AI and ML tactics – depending on the individual case (there are also hybrid systems, like deep learning ). In fact, many people argue that modern deep learning would be considered artificial intelligence even though it relies heavily on neural networks and machine learning."}

If ML is one layer of calculation, then DL involves multiple levels of it predictively building upon the previous results, similar to the human brain. And the company most popular for using Deep Learning is actually Google. They use it almost everywhere, beginning from Search, Translation, Home to the Google Assistant on your phone. The easiest way to think of their relationship is to visualize them as concentric circles with AI — the idea that came first — the largest, then machine learning — which blossomed later, and finally deep learning — which is driving today’s AI explosion — fitting inside both.

The book was written by AI experts Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig. This book covers all aspects of Artificial Intelligence from A to Z, including first-order logic, reinforcement and learning, and neural networks. Possible with Blogs and Websites Some many blogs and websites deal with Data Science. Blogs and websites are one of the best learning tools. They also provide many practical skills and experience. Kdnuggets and Kaggle are some of the most visited blogs and websites. Reddit and Google News on Data Science are two examples of important news sources related to data science. You can even learn AI and Machine learning through the online platforms Online courses are the best way to learn AI. Let's look at some resources that will teach you how to master AI and Machine Learning. HackerEarth How do you start learning AI/ML? HackerEarth is an excellent online resource for engineers and developers who are just starting to learn these technologies. This site offers many blogs and product guides that discuss how to learn AI, Machine Learning. Google Machine Learning Google's \"Introduction to Machine Learning Problem Framing\" online course is another interesting resource. It is a 1-hour-long course that helps you to frame and solve problems with Machine Learning. You will be able to build your data and train your ML model. If you are just starting, you will need to learn everything from the most basic concepts to advanced algorithms. The third option might be a good choice. Online courses in Python Learning Python programming is a great way to get started if you don't have any programming experience. Data Science with Python is another option. It allows you to create and implement popular Predictive Analytics algorithms such as Forecasting and Regression. Also, classification and segmentation ML algorithms such as Random Forest and K Means using Python. This is a great option for beginners who are interested in Data Science. Learning through Courses/Institutes. I recommend that you first build a solid foundation in your technical skills before moving on to a course. This is why I recommend it: A. Although you can certainly learn from free materials online, they do not have a structured curriculum. As a result, it is possible to waste time learning a concept, only to find out later that it wasn't so important. B . Invest in your time, not in saving money. Imagine investing in courses to save one year. C. Many Indians have the mentality that why spend money on a course. Why not? Instead of being stuck in a rut, why not take a course? You will reap the benefits if you do it. You can find courses at some great institutes that I recommend, and you can certainly try them if they suit your goals. You can find courses at some great institutes that I recommend, and you can certainly try them if they suit your goals. Some top institutes/courses can be used to achieve great heights.

Machine learning means learning from data ; AI is a buzzword. Machine learning lives up to the hype: there are an incredible number of problems that you can solve by providing the right training data to the right learning algorithms. Call it AI if that helps you sell it, but know that AI, at least as used outside of academia, is often a buzzword that can mean whatever people want it to mean. Machine learning is about data and algorithms, but mostly data. There’s a lot of excitement about advances in machine learning algorithms, and particularly about deep learning . But data is the key ingredient that makes machine learning possible. You can have machine learning without sophisticated algorithms, but not without good data. Unless you have a lot of data, you should stick to simple models. Machine learning trains a model from patterns in your data, exploring a space of possible models defined by parameters. If your parameter space is too big, you’ll overfit to your training data and train a model that doesn’t generalize beyond it. A detailed explanation requires more math , but as a rule you should keep your models as simple as possible. Machine learning can only be as good as the data you use to train it. The phrase “ garbage in, garbage out ” predates machine learning, but it aptly characterizes a key limitation of machine learning. Machine learning can only discover patterns that are present in your training data. For supervised machine learning tasks like classification , you’ll need a robust collection of correctly labeled, richly featured training data. Machine learning only works if your training data is representative. Just as a fund prospectus warns that “past performance is no guarantee of future results”, machine learning should warn that it’s only guaranteed to work for data generated by the same distribution that generated its training data. Be vigilant of skews between training data and production data, and retrain your models frequently so they don’t become stale. Most of the hard work for machine learning is data transformation. From reading the hype about new machine learning techniques, you might think that machine learning is mostly about selecting and tuning algorithms. The reality is more prosaic: most of your time and effort goes into data cleansing and feature engineering — that is, transforming raw features into features that better represent the signal in your data. Deep learning is a revolutionary advance, but it isn’t a magic bullet. Deep learning has earned its hype by delivering advances across a broad range of machine learning application areas. Moreover, deep learning automates some of the work traditionally performed through feature engineering, especially for image and video data. But deep learning isn’t a silver bullet. You can’t just use it out of the box, and you’ll still need to invest significant effort in data cleansing and transformation. Machine learning systems are highly vulnerable to operator error. With apologies to the NRA, “Machine learning algorithms don’t kill people; people kill people.” When machine learning systems fail, it’s rarely because of problems with the machine learning algorithm. More likely, you’ve introduced human error into the training data, creating bias or some other systematic error. Always be skeptical, and approach machine learning with the discipline you apply to software engineering. Machine learning can inadvertently create a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many applications of machine learning, the decisions you make today affect the training data you collect tomorrow. Once your machine learning system embeds biases into its model, it can continue generating new training data that reinforces those biases. And some biases can ruin people’s lives. Be responsible: don’t create self-fulfilling prophecies. AI is not going to become self-aware, rise up, and destroy humanity. A surprising number of people ( cough ) seem to be getting their ideas about artificial intelligence from science fiction movies. We should be inspired by science fiction, but not so credulous that we mistake it for reality. There are enough real and present dangers to worry about, from consciously evil human beings to unconsciously biased machine learning models. So you can stop worrying about SkyNet and “ superintelligence ”. There’s far more to machine learning than I can explain in a top-10 list. But hopefully this serves as a useful introduction for non-experts."}

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again.

Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5]) 2. Probability and Statistics : A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc. 3. Applied Math + Algorithms : For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16]. 4. Distributed Computing : Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21]. 5. Expertise in Unix Tools : Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1]. 6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects : HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale. 7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques : feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though. Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.

At some point in time in the future, I intend to work again in AI. In my perspective, ML and AI are complementary, but they target different goals. AI has a very specific purpose of building an intelligent agent that can take rational decisions under various different circumstances. By its very nature, the intelligent agent needs to interact with environment that were built for humans and hence must be capable of human-like capabilities i.e reading natural language text, understanding speech, recognizing different objects etc. The application focus is something like, a robot capable of automatically identifying and fixing issues that can occur in a nuclear reactor or a robot capable of self navigation, experimentation and reporting \"interesting\" observations during extra planetary missions etc. From these application, we also get some higher order AI problems. For example, a robot self-navigating a planet, needs to plan and chart its course from point A to point B or a robot that is attempting to fix a leak in a nuclear reactor needs to identify the set of task to perform so that the leak is fixed. The goal of ML is to assimilate known knowledge in an abstract form called models, and be able to predict certain unknowns for instances that will be seen in the future. For example, in an email spam classification task, the goal is to learn a model from a known set of emails that have been labeled as spam or not spam and be able to predict whether the new email that we just received is spam or not spam. Classification is just one concrete instantiation of ML goal. Clustering can be thought of as predicting cluster variables for future instances and Regression can be thought of as predicting function values for points that haven't been observed so far etc. AI with its very specific application focus can use tools built in ML to achieve its goals. However, ML serves a much broader class of problems. With these in mind, what you want to start from is entirely upto you. For example, if you want to build planet-navigating robots then you probably need to start from AI, learn about the various interesting problems involved in AI, see what kind of ML tools you will need to learn, come to ML learn those tools and go back to AI. However, if your interest lies in building the ML tools that serve a fairly broad class of problems many of which are relevant in the real world today [1], then you may want to start learning ML first. Note that, both ML and AI are vast fields with many things to learn. Even though I suggest switching from ML to AI and AI to ML, it is not as easy as it might sound :-). Unless you know what you want to learn and how you plan to use it, you might be aimlessly going into and learning things, that may or may not be relevant to what you might want to do. Not that it is wrong, but, as humans, we have very limited time and we need to use it as efficiently as possible. [1] From a research perspective, researching in ML can get you funds. From a job perspective, many people are hiring folks who have reasonable understanding in ML and can use various tools like weka, libSVM etc."}

Here's how they are connected: Data Science: Data science involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making. Data scientists use a variety of tools and techniques to work with data, including statistical analysis, data visualization, and data manipulation. Data science forms the foundation for ML and AI, as it provides the data needed for training and testing machine learning models. Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML requires a strong understanding of data and statistical concepts to build and evaluate models effectively. Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is a broader field that encompasses ML and goes beyond it. AI involves creating systems that can simulate human intelligence, including tasks like natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making. AI often leverages ML techniques to achieve these goals. While you don't need to become a data scientist before learning ML and AI, having a foundation in data science can be advantageous. Here's why: Data Preparation: Understanding data preprocessing and cleaning is crucial for working with real-world datasets in ML and AI projects. Data scientists are skilled at these tasks. Feature Engineering: Data scientists excel in feature selection and engineering, which are essential for designing effective ML models. Data Exploration: Data science techniques can help you gain valuable insights from the data before building AI or ML models. This can inform your model-building process. Evaluation and Interpretation: Data scientists are experienced in evaluating model performance and interpreting the results, which are crucial aspects of the ML and AI workflow."}
