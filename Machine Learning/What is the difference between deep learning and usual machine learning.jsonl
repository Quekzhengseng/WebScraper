Well, Yes and No. Machine Learning: (Recap) In a nutshell, ML is field of Computer science that uses statistical (or mathematical) techniques to construct a model (or system) from observed data rather than have user enter specific set of instructions that define the model for that data. Though the name seems fancy, sometimes it is as simple as linear regression (in very rudimentary form). A little more complex example is spam detector in your mailbox that \"learns\" which emails are spam, since you never gave instructions for each and every type of email. Loosely speaking, most often, these algorithms work on precise set of features extracted from your raw data. Features could be very simple, such as pixel values for images, temporal values for a signal, or complex features such as Bag of Words feature representation for text. Most known ML algorithms only work as good as the features represent the data. Correct feature identification is that is close representative of your all states of your data is a crucial step. What's the big deal about feature extractor ? Making correct feature extractor is great deal of science in it self. Most of these features extractors (from data) are very specific in function and utility. For ex: for face detection one needs a feature extractor which correctly represents parts of face, resistant to spatial aberrations etc. Each and every type of data and task may have its own class of feature extraction. ( Ex: Speech Recognition, Image Recognition) These feature extractors can then be used to extract correct data features for a given sample, and pass this information to a classifier/ predictor. How is Deep Learning different ? Deep Learning is broader family of Machine Learning methods that tries to learn high level features from the given data. Thus, the problem it solves is reducing task of making new feature extractor for each and every type of data (speech, image etc.) For last example, Deep Learning algo's will try to learn features such as distance between eyes, length of nose etc. features when image recognition task is presented to them. They may use this info for classification, prediction etc tasks. Thus, this is a major step away from previous \"Shallow Learning Algorithms.\" Prof. Andrew Ng remarks that Deep Learning focuses on original aim of One Learning, an ideal Algorithm envisioned for an AI. Long Story Short: If you write this: F(1,2,3.......,100) = 5050 and give it to a ML Algo, then that Algo is like the child which immediately understands that RHS is sum of all numbers in LHS. Given new set of numbers F(1,2,3.......,500) , the childwill then sum up all the numbers upto 500. Then, Deep Learning Algo's are like Carl Fredrich Gauss, which will realize that sum of i th element from forward and backward is always fixed, and can be used to find the sum."}
