Here is a list of must-have traits, in no particular order: You need to enjoy an iterative process of development. If you want to build a machine learning system, you need to be able to build a version 0.1 using a very simple model quickly. Then iterate on getting it better at every successive stage. You also need to have a good intuition for when to stop. In any machine learning system, you can always improve the accuracy by iterating on it more. But at some point, the effort you put into it exceeds the value you derive from it. You need to be able to identify that point. You should be comfortable with failure. A lot of your models and experiments will fail. And that’s ok. You should be driven by curiosity. The best people are the ones who are genuinely curious about the world around them and channel that curiosity when working on machine learning. You need to have a good data intuition. You should be good at identifying patterns in the data. Being able to create quick data visualizations (using R, Python, Matlab or Excel etc.) helps. You need to have a good sense of metrics and be metrics-driven. You should to be able to establish metrics that define success or failure of your system. You should feel comfortable with blind experiments [1] and terms like precision, recall, accuracy, ROC, conversion rates, NDCG etc. Metrics are great at giving a high level view of how your system is doing. But at the same time, you should never stop directly looking at individual examples. Manually looking at your biggest wins and your biggest losses (e.g. worst performing queries for a search engine), as well as random samples of your data, teaches you a lot about your machine learning system that raw metrics don’t. You should be able to develop a generalized approach to fixing the bugs/misclassifications in your models. Fixing individual bugs will only let you attain a local maxima. More often that not, individual fixes will also make your models more complex and harder to work with. Gathering all the issues together and identifying common themes will let you focus on the biggest impact issues that you can fix in your next round of iteration. When developing your models, you should be able to put yourself in the minds of the users / customers of your system. It’s easy to build something that’s good enough for you. But your current and future users matter way more than you do. There are also a lot of biases [2] that affect individual decision making, and you should try to be aware of and account for as many of them as possible. This list was adapted from a blog post I wrote a while ago: What makes a good data scientist/engineer? Footnotes [1] Blind experiment [2] List of cognitive biases"}

This was the first time I came in contact with Machine Learning theory and its applications and, as it was rather complete for an introduction, it helped me make my first steps in understanding the most striking key concepts in the field. Then, I realized that I had to strengthen my skills in math (espacially Linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability Theory), in order to delve deeper into ML theory, so I considered reading books such as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop and Machine Learning by Tom Mitchel along with watching some MOOCs in math. For example, Gilbert Strang’s lectures on Linear Algebra never get old and can be accessed on YouTube, Single Variable Calculus and Multi-Variate Calculus also on YouTube and Harvard’s Statistics 110 . Then I started to familiarize myself with some key languages which I thought would suffice for my future ML application developing such as Python, Java, R and Matlab. Although I had reviewed them during my BSc studies, I thought that revising them was a nice opportunity to refresh my skills and maybe check other problems that I had skipped previously. I would especially recommend implementing a solution to a classification problem in Python using the scikit-learn library at this point (maybe something in text mining), in order to get a first touch with ML engineering. Finally, I became interested in Neural Networks and Deep Learning. However, due to the fact that modules of this kind weren’t a part of our BSc curriculum I figured out that the best solution was to check Geoffrey Hinton’s MOOC on Coursera conserning Neural Networks in order to get a nice grasp from maybe one of the top experts in the field. Later on, I went through reading and implementing the code in Nielsen’s Deep Learning and Neural Networks online book , which was life-changing for me as it is so nicely written, compact and easy to understand. In addition to that, I delved into Deep Learning library tutorials (e.g. Theano , Lasagne and Caffe ), in order to give myself some flexibility concerning which library I could use depending on the problem. I would also like to add that a nice overview of Deep Learning is given in this book of the same name by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville, which also covers the math fundamentals needed to understand how Deep Learning works.

There are several alternatives available to you if you want to get the necessary abilities and begin a career in the field of Machine Learning. There are several colleges on the market that provide Machine Learning courses from where you can simply launch your career. I would suggest Learnbay Institute and Simplilearn Institute among the plethora of institutes since they give the greatest training program and employment help program. The following are the five most essential subjects in machine learning that you should be familiar with: Probability It aids in forecasting the likelihood of occurrences as well as determining if a scenario mayor cannot occur again. The cornerstone of machine learning is said to be a probability. 2. Calculus The topic of calculus is significant in the realm of mathematics, and it is used in a variety of ML methods. Data sets with numerous characteristics are utilized to develop ML models since multiple multivariable calculus is necessary for creating an ML model. Differentiation and integration are two of the most crucial calculus subjects to master. 3. Linear Algebra It is concerned with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It is one of the most significant requirements for studying ML since it can be used to modify and operate on datasets. 4. Statistics It comprises tools that are used to extract results from data. Descriptive statistics are a type of statistics that aid in the transformation of raw data into useful information. Another type of statistics is inferential statistics, which is used to extract essential information from a sample of data using a whole dataset. 5. Programming If we really want to implement the entire Machine Learning process, we must know at least one computer language, such as R or Python. Both of the aforementioned programming languages include built-in libraries that make it relatively simple to construct Machine Learning algorithms. If you want to begin studying the aforementioned machine learning principles, there are a few things you need to do: Recognizing the Prerequisites: Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Statistics, and Python are all prerequisites. You don't need a Ph.D. in these areas to get started, but you do need a basic understanding. Linear Algebra and Multivariate Calculus are both required for Machine Learning. Statistics is a field of mathematics concerned with data collection, analysis, and presentation. As a result, it is unsurprising that you will need to study it. Furthermore, there is one thing you must not overlook: Python. Instructor-led instruction: If you want to switch jobs in machine learning and have both long-term and quick professional advancement, you can learn machine learning through instructor-led courses. Understanding Various ML Concepts: Model, Feature, Target (Label), Training, and Prediction are some of the core ideas in ML. Machine learning may be classified into four types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. You must also investigate several theories and conduct experiments on real-world datasets. This will help you build intuition about which kind of models are appropriate in certain circumstances. Along with these processes, it is critical to understand how to analyze the data obtained by using various models. This is easier to do if you're familiar with the various tuning settings and regularisation methods used on different models. Categorization : It aids in the prediction of discrete variables or a class of data. It involves determining if a person has an illness, whether an email is a spam, whether a transaction is valid or fraudulent, and so forth. Take part in projects: After you've mastered the foundations of Machine Learning, you may go on to the interesting and entertaining portion. PROJECTS! These will effectively improve your ML skills by combining your most theoretical understanding with the actual application. These initiatives will also assist you in your career search in this sector.

The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

There were about 20 of us. We had a couple of lectures every week, usually in some big company’s office. Everything was very informal and laid-back. We coded solutions for Kaggle, wrote our first tech papers and made presentations in front of the group and our mentors. I learned R and Python, did my deal of data processing and played a lot with different models. Mostly ensembles, Random Forests, GBMs. We didn’t dive into math, just had fun and tried out stuff, and that was really good time. I got hooked up even more.

In the summer I got my first job as a data science intern in a startup in Saint-Petersburg. One of our mentors was a CTO there, and the one any founder could dream of. He knew something about everything - I remember him even giving talks about cryptography. But big data and machine learning were the areas where he was great. And his ability to get extraordinary amounts of work done in several hours amazes me even today. I worked with him on a variety of projects, from stat models to developing an async web server just for fun. Good times. In my spare time I was reading, rather lazily, books like PRML, Elements of Statistical Learning and all that math-heavy literature that you can find in any guide “How to become a data scientist” on Quora. That process could be faster, I think, if only I worked more seriously on my math foundation. But I liked coding and tinkering with libraries more, and that’s pretty much how I spent my sophomore year. During summer I started reading academic papers, trying to make sense of the algorithms I was using in my experiments. I continued to maintain contact with data science people from the program who still were arranging talks by experienced people from industry. I was also interested in software development and many other things, so I attended all their lectures and engaged in discussions. That’s how I got into Siemens. Siemens was a good, but brief experience. I didn’t want to dive deeper in corporate software development and several months later I got a remote job. As an ML engineer. For reals. I was 19, the salary was crazy even for a big city, and the job was a blast. I was the only guy working on ML stuff, other developers were more web-focused, so whenever we had a problem that ML could solve, I was getting that project. And I was really proud to do it, because when there’s no other ML devs, you become a sort of lead developer, and that makes you feel responsible for the product ans it sounds cool. Worked my rear off, coded so much things that no online course and no university professor could possibly make me do it. A wild mix of data science, ML eng and good ol’ development - databases, parallel computation, text classification, search, indexing, performance profiling and analysis - you name it, we had it there. The only thing in shortage was the sleep, but who needs it anyway. That lasted for almost a year, I learned mostly on my own, figuring out what works and what doesn’t. Papers from Google and Facebook teams were the main sources of ideas for me, but I can’t say that I benefited greatly from reading ML books. I simply had no time for it, and besides, it was incredibly educational to just try everything yourself. The main model I was developing worked well, but that wasn’t the really important thing in the product inself, so I got plenty of free time. That’s when one of my former mentor, (he’s a very influential data scientist in Moscow now) invited me to write a paper together. We picked a topic that seemed (somewhat) practical, he found a couple of amazing guys to complete the team and we went on a hacking spree. After some struggling in LaTeX and fiddling with models on Amazon server we submitted the bloody thing and sighed with relief. We did it. Another thing off my bucket list. Looking back, I understand - that was a really formative experience for me. It taught me to look for the strict coherent structure in my work and, I think, eventually pushed me towards research. However, most of all at that time, I loved collective hacking. Just to sit with a bunch of guys and pick an interesting thing to code, order some pizza, usual stuff. Finally, an incredible opportunity appeared: a new lab in Moscow organized a hackathon. Oh, how pumped I was - ML competition, invited lecturers from top world labs, lots of very knowledgeable and proficient ML people, that’s going to be amazing. It didn’t go exactly according to my plan, but it worked out pretty cool. I ended up in a great team with a wild range of skills - I picked something from everyone in that team, which is the best advice I could give to someone who is still trying to figure things out for themselves: learn from people. They were there, they saw the problem, they know far more than a book could tell you. Don’t ask them to give you some kind of lecture or guidance, instead make them excited and build stuff together. All kinds of marvels will happen in between. But the greatest marvel was still ahead. We were killing it - and eventually won the competition. Now, during the hackathon there were two guys whose names you can see all over the top conferences. They did some sort of interview where we introduced ourselves and told about our experience. That was funny, because I was still an undergrad and we had a guy with PhD, a guy with ~8 years of industry exp, an HFT guy, you get the idea. My undergrad project was rather dull and honestly, I didn’t like it much. Should have spend more time thinking everything through. Still, learned about RNN, wrote my own tool for hierarchical RNNs, got hands-on experience with deep learning, nothing to complain about. A month into the project, I got an email from Facebook. Welcome to FAIR. Pack your things, nerd, you are going to do science. Fast forward to the present - I have found a fountain of knowledge and it looks and feels like a firehose. I can’t tell you about the project, but I can tell you about the growth. It is exponential. It immediately dwarfes everything I’ve done before and shows me what I’m really capable of. Now I understand that after those four years I still know nothing. But that’s okay. It will always be that way, because for some people it’s never enough. Four years are nothing. Maybe ten will feel more substantial, but I doubt it. I’ve just started, in a very carefree way, playing with numbers and having fun. When you stop worrying about things that don’t matter that much, about how robots will take our jobs and WoW accounts and make our lives miserable, you can do something interesting. Sure, there will be people who will like it and find it useful. And that’s my way to grow."}

Here are some reasons. It’s really, really hard to build AI-based software products. It’s actually really hard to build any software products especially for people without much experience doing so. And because you are an AI expert (let’s assume), you probably aren’t also an expert in software development. You’ll likely discover to your disappointment that building real software products is a lot harder than building simple prototypes. You may also discover that your plan to surround yourself in great developers who can easily integrate your AI-based ideas is not entirely practical either. You may believe that all this great stuff that you are learning about say recurrent neural networks or convolutional architectures are going to be useful for a long time or something that you’ll be building on for years. To your dismay you’ll find that every two years or so the field will have moved away from that and on to something else that you don’t yet understand. This is the nature of AI these days and says something quite meaningful about the lack of a firm foundation and how it’s really an engineering field not a mathematical field. Pick up any book on AI from the 1990s and you’ll notice that almost everything seems foreign and largely abandoned. Realize that, at that time, all these researchers thought they were on to something really big too and imagined those ideas as core components of useful products. The more deeply you understand how AI algorithms work, the more you will realize how the problem it is solving is really not as hard as you thought it was. Another way of saying that is that you’ll realize that things like image classification are nowhere near as hard as lots of other things people do. And while this is making great progress, it is expanding within a constrained area of intelligence. Most of it is concerned with perception and there is no natural path from perceiving the world to building a complex model of the world. If you’re completely new to the business world you may have to learn the hard lesson that just because we can do something doesn’t mean we should do it. It has to be economically feasible and also worth the risk. There is a reasonable possibility that things like self-driving cars (at least level 5) are possible but too expensive to make it practical any time soon. There are many places where today’s AI can replace a human workflow but will take 6 months for a team of 4 to implement which will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That may not pay off for many years and it could fail. And so someone who makes more money than you but doesn’t understand AI will make a business decision to pass on your great idea. Despite these pessimistic thoughts, I don’t want to discourage anyone from going into this field. If you are young and someone is willing to pay you to work on cool stuff and give you great experience, then why not? Worst case is that you fail to deliver much value but learn some valuable lessons that become useful to you in the future. Eventually, you’ll succeed at something though it may not be what you expected."}

Actually, the first thing you need to do is ignore most of the advice on this thread. Not only is most of it shit, I doubt a single poster has ever worked in the real-world as a machine learning engineer. I’ll say it a few times so it sinks it. We machine learning engineers are programmers, not mathematicians. More reguritated math lies. Ok, moving on from the shitty advice. There’s NO SUCH THING as an AI Engineer. It’s a fabricated title. Next up… the top job in all of AI is the machine learning engineer. It’s been at the top for three years now. A machine learning engineer is a programmer with incredible data skills. Here’s what one of the world’s greatest researchers has to say. Ng observes that 80% of the AI developer’s time is spent on data preparation. What that means is, most of the job of a machine learning engineer is data cleansing and sourcing, NOT MODELING. More from Ng. “The model and the code for many applications are basically a solved problem,” says Ng. “Now that the models have advanced to a certain point, we got to make the data work as well.” Ok, now you know you want to be a machine learning engineer. Your next question is… what’s involved. Here you go: What do you need to learn and why? SQL. Why? Because all machine learning models are fed data. The cleaner your data the more accurate your model. Most machine learning models right now are based on data from relational data stores. All relational data stores speak SQL. You’ll need to write the Query to extract that data for modeling. Real-world data is dirty and working with it sucks. If you don’t have SQL skills you’re doomed. Python . Why? Python has become the gold standard for machine learning in the real-world. It’s the language you’ll use for just about everything once your data is amalgamated in a data store or CSV file. Libraries. Why and what are they? A library is code that’s pre-bundled. You simply have to import the library to use all the functionality. Libraries are as important as Python. If you don’t know the libraries you won’t get a job. There are libraries for just about every facet to machine learning. You don’t have to know all the libraries, but there are a core group you’ll use every day. These you must know. Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, matplotlib… a few more. Data Cleansing. Why and what is it? Data cleansing are all the tasks you’ll need to learn to prepare your data for modeling. Remember when I said data was dirty? Extracting your data is the first part when working with data. The fun part is data cleansing. It’s what you’ll spend more of your time doing. I promise. Applied Statistics . Why? The process of working with a dataset and developing a predictive model is also a task in statistics. Although statistics is a large field with many esoteric theories and findings, the nuts and bolts tools and notations taken from the field are required for machine learning practitioners. You’ll use those libraries we talked about above, mostly Scikit-Learn, to apply statistical techniques to your data. That part of data cleansing ,knowing what statistical techniques to apply when and why. Notice the world applied? Applied means just that, applying the statistical techniques that are already written. You don’t do any statistical calculation yourself. They are written inside of the libraries. Modeling. Why? A model is simply a computer algorithm or group of them that look for patterns in your data. When they find a pattern they return and output. We call them models. There are different types of models for different types of problems. For example, the most common type of task in the real-world is classification. A group of ensemble models excel at this task. They are called gradient boosters. When you’re working with structured data and your problem is a classification task, you’ll want to use a gradient boosters. There are two core types of models. They are called traditional models and deep learning models and each has their own use case. Tuning. What is it? Tuning a model means making tweaks to parameters called hyperparameters. The default model might not provide you with the best result. So, you’ll need to know what hyperparameters to tune for a given model. Yes, different models will have different hyperparameters. However, since you really won’t be using that many models in the real-world, learning them isn’t that difficult and the default model is pretty well tuned. Production . Why? The only reason you’re going through all this work is so that you can produce a model that will make a prediction on fresh data. Fresh data is data the model has never seen. This is the end goal of all models. Now, how a model is put in production will depend on the type of model. If the model is real-time, a front end will need to be created so it can be consumed. If the model is batch, then you’ll need to create that process to output the file to a location where the results can be consumed. Niches. Why? There are many different subfield you can move into after you have a foundation in machine learning. For example, there are people who only study NLP or Natural Language Process. There are others that only study computer vision. Yet others study reinforcement learning. I focus solely on gradient boosters and ensemble models because they are the gold standard for regression and classification, the most seen problems in the real-worlds. So, where do you learn it? Here’s the only platform out there created by real-world machine learning engineers. Now, some real-world advice. Machine learning engineers are some of the most technical people in all of IT. You don’t get there overnight. You’ll need to set some realistic expectations or you’ll be working with the rest of your data science buddies at Starbucks. Companies aren’t handing 250K salaries for easy. If it were that easy, there wouldn’t be hundreds of thousands of jobs open worldwide that aren’t being filled. All these super smart college kids would be taking them. Pssst… that’s not happening and it won’t. In conclusion. The jobs are there and they aren’t going away. Actually, they are increasing rapidly. Most won’t make it. If you think you have what it takes I’d suggest you start reading this thread to understand what real-world machine learning looks like. LogikBot"}
