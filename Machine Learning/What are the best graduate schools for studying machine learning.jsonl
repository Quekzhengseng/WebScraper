In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn’t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don’t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It’s also tough to put your writing out there when you’re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you’re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance , Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way. Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly’s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as “on” instead of “in”), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers . Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium , speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag “false friends,” or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one’s primary language but don’t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium’s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar. Simply click on the suggestion highlighted in green, and voila, your English will be more polished and accurate. PS: Tailored suggestions for other language backgrounds are on the way!"}

Most schools only have a handful of professors that work in ML-related areas, so prior reputation of a school is not 100% indicative that you'll find opportunities there. For example, a school like Stanford is overall extremely strong, but many of its core ML professors are currently very busy with startups (e.g., Coursera). In my opinion, the most important thing in doing a PhD is to have a good fit with your advisor. Roughly speaking, I would say that most of the schools in the top 40 (as ranked by US News) have 10–20 professors actively working in ML-related areas, and 2–6 in core machine learning (i.e., regularly publishing at ICML, NIPS, KDD, etc). I also wouldn't blindly trust the faculty listings on school websites -- those are usually inflated. CMU is about an order of magnitude bigger with about 8-12 faculty in core ML (the machine learning department at CMU is actually pretty small, so the faculty count is not as ginormous as some might think). So CMU is more robust to individual faculty leaving or not being research active due to a startup. But there are also more students there interested in ML so that leads to more competition for faculty advising. [This paragraph was edited September 2017] Currently (ca 2017), some other schools at the high end of the 2–6 core ML faculty are Berkeley, Cornell, UWashington, GA Tech, UCSD, and UMass Amherst. I would also say that Northwestern, Penn State, and UNC currently have a dearth of core ML professors (at least based on my observations at ICML, NIPS, KDD, etc). Finally, keep in mind that different professors work on very different topics, even if it's all under the umbrella of machine learning. Research universities try to hire professors that are doing both interesting and novel work, so each professor's research profile is unique to some degree. I hear that Caltech has some interesting professors ;)"}

The bottom line is to find the professors who do the work you want to do and to go wherever they are.

This makes a huge difference long-term Be diversified, especially when you are older. Putting all your eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense. The key differences about living abroad are: You usually can’t get access to your home countries social security system. Back home, investing 10% of whatever you make might be enough for retirement, because you are paying into the retirement system. Many expats panic when they are older, after not putting enough aside for themselves and their family in the previous years. Tax-efficient local investment vehicles, such as ISAs in the UK, aren’t usually available for expats, so offshore investing makes more sense for most non-American expats. For American expats, most forms of offshore investing have became too difficult due to PFIC and other rules Many people are on fixed-term contracts overseas. If you are a teacher back home, you can still have a position for life, or at least it is difficult to fire you. Overseas, you are often paid more, but are on two or three year contracts working in teaching, oil & gas, intergovernmental organizations etc. This makes saving and investing even more important. Many investment providers won’t accept for certain overseas countries. Even those who do, often have restrictions if you move again. So, finding a truly portable, global and expat-friendly provider is key. So, the same fundamentals apply, but the urgency is often bigger.

That said, there are two universities which very, very clearly rise to the top of the pack as far as modern deep machine learning goes. Those are the University of Toronto, and the University of Montreal. I have no affiliation with either university (sadly), but the truth is that these two universities have largely pulled ahead of most, if not all, of the other top universities in the field in deep learning research. NYU, and Stanford are probably the two US universities I would place immediately after uToronto and uMontreal, largely because of their faculty. That said, it really depends on which area of ML you want to study. If you want to look into old-school computer vision (think Haar, Sift, and color thresholding) then a university like CMU or MIT will work excellently for your purposes. That said, most of these approaches are only still relevant in robotics (due to computational bandwidth). If you're interested in speech recognition there are a number of universities doing novel research there, I would again mention CMU, largely because of their CMU sphinx library. That said, this is again an area where a great number of universities have excellent staff available. If you're interested in statistical NLP I would recommend Stanford first and foremost, but statistical NLP is an area where there are again a huge number of excellent universities, Stanford has a large open source project though, which has drawn in a number of very skilled professionals. The short of it is it depends very, very highly on the field of machine learning that you want to study. If you're interested in modern approaches, uMontreal, uToronto, and NYU have excellent staff on board and will allow you to associate with some of the best known minds in the field (Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann Lecun respectively). There are a number of universities that also offer good programs here though. If you're interested in older, more proven machine learning applications the field is much wider, and most of the universities listed in other answers will provide an excellent education. Not sure if you're interested, but uMontreal and uToronto have almost become feeders into industry research labs (mostly Google). This could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on where you're coming from."}

That's because ML is a huge field right now, with several different major approaches, and it depends what approach appeals most to you. So if you're serious about picking a school, these lists are just starting points.  You'll have to look over the schools' current faculty lists (it's very fluid right now), find the professors whose work appeals to you, and probably look over some of their papers or try to talk to their students to get a feeling for the intellectual and inter-personal style in their group. 2. One thing that perhaps the other answers have not emphasized enough is that, while a few people study machine learning in some pure sense -- algorithms that can be used for anything -- most of the best work in this \"hot\" field involves applying machine learning to something else, whether it's understanding natural language and speech, image and video analysis, controlling the motions of a robot or drone or car, looking at tweets and social-media posts of all kinds to predict trends or elections, and so on -- the list is endless.  So unless you're one of the pure algorithms people (and maybe even if you are one of them), you'll want to look closely at a school's strength in whatever neighboring field(s) appeal to you.  And look also at whether there are already strong faculty in those areas who are applying ML to domains in which they already have expertise. 3. OK, here's the commercial, totally unbiased of course.  :-)  While every school has some stars, Carnegie Mellon is unusual -- arguably unique -- in its breadth in ML and in almost all of the adjacent areas where ML is being (or could be) applied. As others have noted, we have a whole Machine Learning Department. Tom Mitchell has forged something very special there by building such a strong bridge between the AI-oriented ML people and the already-strong statistics department at CMU. We also have a whole Language Technologies Institute (a department in the School of Computer Science) devoted to natural language processing, natural language understanding, and speech. We have a Robotics Institute (department) that is one of the leaders in image and video processing, autonomous vehicles, and many other areas. We have a Human Computer Interaction Institute, within which there is a very strong group working on education. We have an Entertainment Technology Center working on computer games, broadly defined. We have the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management, where people are looking at the application of ML to national and international programs that improve people's lives.  And in our Tepper School of Management, people are looking a the application of ML to production, commerce, and finance. And the list goes on -- even extending into music and art and literary analysis. There are people already working on ML in each of these areas, others who are very open to collaboration, and some people in each of these departments who are good enough at ML to make contributions to the field itself.  It's important not only to have lots of good departments, but to have a culture where all the boundaries are permeable. OK, end of commercial.  I mention this not just to sell you on CMU -- we have no trouble finding excellent students right now -- but to emphasize the desirability of being at a place that is strong in many application areas, and is not just a couple of ML professors out in the woods doing excellent work.  In fairness, I should say that some of the other schools have done an excellent job of using their ties to industry to tap into domain expertise that may not be present on their campus."}

However, with so many different universities and programs out there, it can be difficult to make your decision about which one is right for you. Since many people are interested in pursuing an education at a machine learning graduate school, I decided to write a list of the best such schools. I will also provide some background information about each school, and what you can expect as a student, and also describe projects that are making progress in this field. The following information is provided as information only and is not necessarily endorsed by any organization. Best Machine Learning Graduate Schools Many different graduate schools offer courses on machine learning. Below is a summary outlining some of the top graduate schools are: IIT Gandhi Nagar, Chennai, India USC ICT, Rome, Italy EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX USA MIT Cambridge, MA Graduate Student Expectations As a graduate student in machine learning, you can expect to do research and pursue your projects. The most common research topics are regression/machine learning from data with statistical machine learning methods as well as unsupervised methods (e.g., clustering), recommender systems, and statistical approaches to web data mining. Students will spend much of their time developing their skills by writing code and solving practical problems. Many online platforms provide courses on Machine learning. Online learning is much more convenient as you can study at a flexible time at affordable rates. I recommend you to check out top ed tech platforms like Coursera, EdX, Udacity, Udemy, Learnbay, etc. It provides one of the best machine-learning courses available. One of the top ML courses available is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program. The best part is that instructors conduct live sessions, so they are always available, and the fees are very reasonable. Not only that, but this institute has a plethora of features that make it an ideal platform for learning machine learning. Some of the best features of this platform are: It is a professional development platform designed specifically for working professionals. It provides online courses on Machine Learning as well as live sessions by top instructors. Another unique feature available to students is domain electives , which are the best option for those who want to learn data science in a specific field. This is accomplished by providing capstone training that includes case-based exercises and experiments to provide students with the agile techniques they need to succeed. Marketing, sales, oil and gas, HR, BFSI, IoT, and many other domain electives are available. This course includes course completion, project completion, and a micro-skills certificate. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Program comes up with multiple projects. Some of the top ML projects include Image Classifier and IBM Analytics. These projects can be made in a hybrid setup. This means that students can directly get in touch with expert mentors to complete the project through offline project innovation labs set up. These labs are present in several top cities including Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, etc. CONCLUSION On a concluding note, learning ML is a challenging process and it is important to do so in a structured manner, with mentors on hand. The best way to prepare yourself for this is to enroll at one of the top platforms, such as Learnbay . Thank you"}

CMU’s program is designed to be completed in only one year, and the school also offers an online version of the course. Stanford University in Stanford, California It is another top choice for students interested in machine learning. Their Department of Computer Science has a strong focus on AI and machine learning, and they offer several graduate programs in these areas. Cornell University Cornell University is ranked as the best graduate school for machine learning. Machine Learning at Cornell is an interdisciplinary program which includes courses in statistics, computer science, engineering, and math. However, there are many great graduate schools for studying machine learning, but these three are among the best. But if you're interested in pursuing a career in data science, and are running out of time with keeping up a regular schedule, there are some courses that can offer top-notch programs and resources to help you achieve your goals . Let’s see what are some of those courses: Advanced AI and ML course for tech professionals What makes this institute a great place to study machine learning?
